VOLUME I

CHAPTER I

Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home
and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings
of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world
with very little to distress or vex her. 

She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,
indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,
been mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother
had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct
remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied
by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short
of a mother in affection. 

Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,
less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,
but particularly of Emma.  Between them it was more the intimacy
of sisters.  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal
office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed
her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being
now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and
friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;
highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by
her own. 

The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having
rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little
too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened
alloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present
so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes
with her. 

Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any
disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss
Taylor's loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day
of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought
of any continuance.  The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,
her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect
of a third to cheer a long evening.  Her father composed himself
to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit
and think of what she had lost. 

"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.  We must go in the carriage,
to be sure."

"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for
such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we
are paying our visit?"

"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.  You know we
have settled all that already.  We talked it all over with Mr. Weston
last night.  And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like
going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. 
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.  That was
your doing, papa.  You got Hannah that good place.  Nobody thought
of Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!"

"I am very glad I did think of her.  It was very lucky, for I would
not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;
and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,
pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.  Whenever I see her,
she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;
and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she
always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. 
I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great
comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is
used to see.  Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,
she will be hearing of us.  He will be able to tell her how we
all are."

Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,
and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably
through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. 
The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards
walked in and made it unnecessary. 

Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not
only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly
connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. 
He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,
and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,
as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.  He had
returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked
up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square. 
It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time. 
Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;
and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and her children were
answered most satisfactorily.  When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse
gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come
out at this late hour to call upon us.  I am afraid you must have
had a shocking walk."

"Not at all, sir.  It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild
that I must draw back from your great fire."

"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.  I wish you may
not catch cold."

"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.  Not a speck on them."

"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal
of rain here.  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour
while we were at breakfast.  I wanted them to put off the wedding."

"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware
of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry
with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. 
How did you all behave? Who cried most?"

"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."

"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly
say `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma;
but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At
any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."

"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"
said Emma playfully.  "That is what you have in your head,
I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."

"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,
unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their
own concerns.  You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,
than good to them, by interference."

"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,"
rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.  "But, my dear,
pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up
one's family circle grievously."

"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.  Poor Mr. Elton! You
like Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. 
There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him--and he has been
here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably,
that it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought
when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if
he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think
very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing
him a service."

"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very
good young man, and I have a great regard for him.  But if you
want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come
and dine with us some day.  That will be a much better thing. 
I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."

"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr. Knightley,
laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much
better thing.  Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best
of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. 
Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care
of himself."

CHAPTER II

Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property.  He had received a good education, but,
on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become
indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers
were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social
temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied. 

Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances
of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,
of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love
with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,
who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,
which the connexion would offend. 

Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command
of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the
family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it
took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,
who threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion,
and did not produce much happiness.  Mrs. Weston ought to have found
more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper
made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness
of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,
she had not the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue
her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain
from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,
nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.  They lived beyond
their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:
she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once
to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe. 

Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,
as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst
of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,
he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. 
From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. 
The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering
illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;
and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,
nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to
take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease. 
Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed
to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,
the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,
and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to
improve as he could. 

A complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia
and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a
good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening. 
It was a concern which brought just employment enough.  He had still
a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;
and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,
the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away. 
He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure
the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had
always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even
as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own
friendly and social disposition. 

It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence
his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth
on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling
till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long
looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects
in view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune,
bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new
period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness
than in any yet passed through.  He had never been an unhappy man;
his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;
but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly
amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof
of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,
to excite gratitude than to feel it. 

He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was
his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought
up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption
as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age. 
It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his
father's assistance.  His father had no apprehension of it. 
The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;
but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice
could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,
so deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London,
and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine
young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. 
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his
merits and prospects a kind of common concern. 

Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively
curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little
returned that he had never been there in his life.  His coming
to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved. 

Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,
as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. 
There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when
Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and
Miss Bates returned the visit.  Now was the time for Mr. Frank
Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was
understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. 
For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention
of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.  "I suppose you
have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written
to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. 
Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he
says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life."

It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.  Mrs. Weston had, of course,
formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,
and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression
of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.  She felt
herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough
to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only
regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship
for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her. 

She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,
without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering
an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear
Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation
than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,
and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily
through its little difficulties and privations.  And then there was
such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,
so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's
disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching
season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the
week together. 

Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude
to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her
satisfaction---her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,
was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,
was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity
`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre
of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening
attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. 
But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,
and saying, "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay."

There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of
ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation
to Mr. Woodhouse.  The compliments of his neighbours were over;
he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;
and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,
was all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he
could never believe other people to be different from himself. 
What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;
and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having
any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly
tried to prevent any body's eating it.  He had been at the pains
of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.  Mr. Perry
was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one
of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,
he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the
bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree
with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. 
With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped
to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the
cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till
it was all gone. 

There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys
being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their
hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it. 

CHAPTER III

Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.  He liked very much
to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,
from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,
from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the
visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. 
He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;
his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit
for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms. 
Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,
and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,
comprehended many such.  Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion,
he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening
parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any
time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week
in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him. 

Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;
and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,
the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude
for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room,
and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being
thrown away. 

After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able
of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies
almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,
and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse
thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.  Had it
taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance. 

Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a
very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. 
She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was
considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,
under such untoward circumstances, can excite.  Her daughter enjoyed
a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,
handsome, rich, nor married.  Miss Bates stood in the very worst
predicament in the world for having much of the public favour;
and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,
or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect. 
She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.  Her youth
had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted
to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small
income go as far as possible.  And yet she was a happy woman,
and a woman whom no one named without good-will.  It was her own
universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. 
She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness,
quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate
creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,
and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted
for nothing.  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,
her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,
and a mine of felicity to herself.  She was a great talker upon
little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial
communications and harmless gossip. 

Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,
or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of
refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,
upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for
enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but
a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable
quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,
and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble
themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming
back prodigies.  Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and
very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy
spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty
of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,
and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands. 
It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
after her to church.  She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,
who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled
to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly
owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim
on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,
whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside. 

These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently
able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake,
in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,
it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.  She was delighted
to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with
herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings
of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent
was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated. 

As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close
of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,
in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;
a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,
whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,
on account of her beauty.  A very gracious invitation was returned,
and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion. 

Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.  Somebody had
placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school,
and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar
to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known
of her history.  She had no visible friends but what had been
acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit
in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her. 

She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort
which Emma particularly admired.  She was short, plump, and fair,
with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,
and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,
Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite
determined to continue the acquaintance. 

She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's
conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not
inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,
shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly
grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly
impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style
to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,
and deserve encouragement.  Encouragement should be given. 
Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be
wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions. 
The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her. 
The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort
of people, must be doing her harm.  They were a family of the name
of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm
of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,
she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they
must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates
of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance
to be quite perfect.  She would notice her; she would improve her;
she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her
into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. 
It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;
highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers. 

She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking
and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that
the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,
which always closed such parties, and for which she had been
used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,
and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.  With an
alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never
indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,
with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,
did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend
the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she
knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests. 

Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare. 
He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion
of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome
made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his
hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,
his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat. 

Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that
he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he
might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing
the nicer things, to say:

"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. 
An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling
an egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled
by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,
you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates,
let Emma help you to a little bit of tart--a very little bit. 
Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome
preserves here.  I do not advise the custard.  Mrs. Goddard, what say
you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler
of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."

Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in
a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had
particular pleasure in sending them away happy.  The happiness
of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.  Miss Woodhouse
was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the
introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,
grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,
delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated
her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!

CHAPTER IV

Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. 
Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,
and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,
so did their satisfaction in each other.  As a walking companion,
Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her. 
In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.  Her father
never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground
sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;
and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined. 
She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;
and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any
time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. 
But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,
and was confirmed in all her kind designs. 

Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,
grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring
to be guided by any one she looked up to.  Her early attachment
to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,
and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that
there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must
not be expected.  Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet
Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the
something which her home required.  Such a friend as Mrs. Weston
was out of the question.  Two such could never be granted. 
Two such she did not want.  It was quite a different sort of thing,
a sentiment distinct and independent.  Mrs. Weston was the object
of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. 
Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. 
For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing. 

Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who
were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.  She was ready to tell
every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. 
Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never
believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered
the truth.  Harriet had no penetration.  She had been satisfied
to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;
and looked no farther. 

Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the
school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and
but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,
it must have been the whole.  But the Martins occupied her thoughts
a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe
the many comforts and wonders of the place.  Emma encouraged her
talkativeness-- amused by such a picture of another set of beings,
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much
exultation of Mrs. Martin's having "two parlours, two very good parlours,
indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room;
and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years
with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,
and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;
and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be
called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house
in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink
tea:-- a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people."

For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;
but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose. 
She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,
a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared
that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always
mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something
or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,
no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little
friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she
were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever. 

With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number
and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,
and there was evidently no dislike to it.  Harriet was very ready
to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry
evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured
and obliging.  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring
her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,
and in every thing else he was so very obliging.  He had his
shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. 
She was very fond of singing.  He could sing a little himself. 
She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing. 
He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,
he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country. 
She believed every body spoke well of him.  His mother and sisters
were very fond of him.  Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there
was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body
to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,
he would make a good husband.  Not that she wanted him to marry. 
She was in no hurry at all. 

"Well done, Mrs. Martin!" thought Emma.  "You know what you are about."

"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send
Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had
ever seen.  Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all
the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,
to sup with her."

"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line
of his own business? He does not read?"

"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has
read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of. 
He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay
in one of the window seats--but he reads all them to himself. 
But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read
something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. 
And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.  He never read the
Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.  He had never
heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined
to get them now as soon as ever he can."

The next question was--

"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"

"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.  I thought him very plain
at first, but I do not think him so plain now.  One does not, you know,
after a time.  But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every
now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way
to Kingston.  He has passed you very often."

"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without
having any idea of his name.  A young farmer, whether on horseback
or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. 
The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I
can have nothing to do.  A degree or two lower, and a creditable
appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their
families in some way or other.  But a farmer can need none of my help,
and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every
other he is below it."

"To be sure.  Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have
observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight."

"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. 
I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. 
What do you imagine his age to be?"

"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is
the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd."

"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle.  His mother is
perfectly right not to be in a hurry.  They seem very comfortable
as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,
she would probably repent it.  Six years hence, if he could meet
with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,
with a little money, it might be very desirable."

"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"

"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,
who are not born to an independence.  Mr. Martin, I imagine,
has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with
the world.  Whatever money he might come into when his father died,
whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,
all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,
with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to
impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."

"To be sure, so it is.  But they live very comfortably. 
They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;
and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year."

"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does
marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though
his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether
objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit
for you to notice.  The misfortune of your birth ought to make you
particularly careful as to your associates.  There can be no doubt
of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your
claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there
will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you."

"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.  But while I visit
at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,
I am not afraid of what any body can do."

"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I
would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be
independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.  I want to see you
permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable
to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say
that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,
I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,
to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere
farmer's daughter, without education."

"To be sure.  Yes.  Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body
but what had had some education--and been very well brought up. 
However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I
am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.  I shall
always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,
and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well
educated as me.  But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,
certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it."

Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,
and saw no alarming symptoms of love.  The young man had been
the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,
and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side,
to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own. 

They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the
Donwell road.  He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully
at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. 
Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;
and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made
her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. 
His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,
but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be
contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground
he had gained in Harriet's inclination.  Harriet was not insensible
of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness
with admiration as well as wonder.  Mr. Martin looked as if he
did not know what manner was. 

They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must
not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a
smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse
hoped very soon to compose. 

"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was
quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. 
He did not think we ever walked this road.  He thought we walked
towards Randalls most days.  He has not been able to get the
Romance of the Forest yet.  He was so busy the last time he was
at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. 
So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he
like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him
so very plain?"

"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is
nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.  I had no
right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no
idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air. 
I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."

"To be sure," said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he is not
so genteel as real gentlemen."

"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,
that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. 
At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,
well bred men.  I should be surprized if, after seeing them,
you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving
him to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at
yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before. 
Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure
you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,
and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated
as I stood here."

"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.  He has not such a fine
air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.  I see the difference
plain enough.  But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"

"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair
to compare Mr. Martin with him.  You might not see one in a hundred
with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.  But he is
not the only gentleman you have been lately used to.  What say you
to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of them. 
Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;
of being silent.  You must see the difference."

"Oh yes!--there is a great difference.  But Mr. Weston is almost
an old man.  Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."

"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.  The older a
person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners
should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,
or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.  What is passable in youth
is detestable in later age.  Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;
what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?"

"There is no saying, indeed," replied Harriet rather solemnly. 

"But there may be pretty good guessing.  He will be a completely gross,
vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking
of nothing but profit and loss."

"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."

"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended. 
He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing
else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.  What has
he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he will thrive,
and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse
need not disturb us."

"I wonder he did not remember the book"--was all Harriet's answer,
and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might
be safely left to itself.  She, therefore, said no more for some time. 
Her next beginning was,

"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior
to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. 
They might be more safely held up as a pattern.  There is an openness,
a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body
likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it--but
that would not do to be copied.  Neither would Mr. Knightley's
downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits
him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem
to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,
he would not be sufferable.  On the contrary, I think a young man
might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. 
Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. 
He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.  I do not
know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either
of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his
manners are softer than they used to be.  If he means any thing,
it must be to please you.  Did not I tell you what he said of you
the other day?"

She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn
from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed
and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable. 

Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving
the young farmer out of Harriet's head.  She thought it would
be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,
and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it. 
She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict. 
It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled
her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during
the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.  The longer
she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency. 
Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,
and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family
that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.  He had a
comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;
for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known
to have some independent property; and she thought very highly
of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,
without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world. 

She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful
girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,
was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be
little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all
the usual weight and efficacy.  And he was really a very pleasing
young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. 
He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,
though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which
she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified
by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts
for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration. 

CHAPTER V

"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley, "of
this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing."

"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?-- why so?"

"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."

"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her
with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. 
I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. 
How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any
good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels
about Emma, Mr. Knightley."

"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,
knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."

"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,
for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.  We were speaking
of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,
that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. 
Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. 
You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value
of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort
a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used
to it all her life.  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. 
She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. 
But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,
it will be an inducement to her to read more herself.  They will
read together.  She means it, I know."

"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve
years old.  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at
various times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and
very good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly
arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. 
The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it
did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;
and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.  But I
have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. 
She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,
and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor
failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do
nothing.-- You never could persuade her to read half so much as you
wished.--You know you could not."

"I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought
so then;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's
omitting to do any thing I wished."

"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,"--said
Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.  "But I,"
he soon added, "who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,
must still see, hear, and remember.  Emma is spoiled by being the
cleverest of her family.  At ten years old, she had the misfortune of
being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. 
She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. 
And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house
and of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope
with her.  She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been
under subjection to her."

"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on
your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted
another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for
me to any body.  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held."

"Yes," said he, smiling.  "You are better placed here; very fit
for a wife, but not at all for a governess.  But you were preparing
yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. 
You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would
seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her,
on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,
and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend
him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."

"Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife
to such a man as Mr. Weston."

"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,
and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing
to be borne.  We will not despair, however.  Weston may grow cross
from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him."

"I hope not that.--It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not
foretell vexation from that quarter."

"Not I, indeed.  I only name possibilities.  I do not pretend to Emma's
genius for foretelling and guessing.  I hope, with all my heart,
the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But
Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.  I think
her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. 
She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. 
She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,
because undesigned.  Her ignorance is hourly flattery.  How can
Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet
is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,
I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance. 
Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places
she belongs to.  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable
with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home. 
I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind,
or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties
of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish."

"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more
anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. 
How well she looked last night!"

"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?
Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."

"Pretty! say beautiful rather.  Can you imagine any thing nearer
perfect beauty than Emma altogether-- face and figure?"

"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have
seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. 
But I am a partial old friend."

"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,
open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,
and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,
her glance.  One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture
of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete
picture of grown-up health.  She is loveliness itself.  Mr. Knightley,
is not she?"

"I have not a fault to find with her person," he replied. 
"I think her all you describe.  I love to look at her; and I
will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. 
Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little
occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am
not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread
of its doing them both harm."

"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its
not doing them any harm.  With all dear Emma's little faults,
she is an excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter,
or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities
which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;
she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the
right a hundred times."

"Very well; I will not plague you any more.  Emma shall be an angel,
and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John
and Isabella.  John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore
not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;
except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children. 
I am sure of having their opinions with me."

"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;
but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,
you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's
mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think
any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made
a matter of much discussion among you.  Pray excuse me; but supposing
any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,
it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,
who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,
so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.  It has been so
many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,
Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office."

"Not at all," cried he; "I am much obliged to you for it. 
It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your
advice has often found; for it shall be attended to."

"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy
about her sister."

"Be satisfied," said he, "I will not raise any outcry.  I will keep
my ill-humour to myself.  I have a very sincere interest in Emma. 
Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a
greater interest; perhaps hardly so great.  There is an anxiety,
a curiosity in what one feels for Emma.  I wonder what will become
of her!"

"So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."

"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,
means just nothing at all.  But I have no idea that she has yet
ever seen a man she cared for.  It would not be a bad thing for her
to be very much in love with a proper object.  I should like to see
Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. 
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom
from home."

"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break
her resolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be;
and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be
forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties
on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account.  I do not recommend matrimony
at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."

Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of
her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. 
There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it
was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition
which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "What does Weston
think of the weather; shall we have rain?" convinced her that he
had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield. 

CHAPTER VI

Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy
a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity
to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible
than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most
agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up
the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon
pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side,
as there could be any occasion for.  She was quite convinced
of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love,
if not in love already.  She had no scruple with regard to him. 
He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. 
His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner,
since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least
agreeable proofs of his growing attachment. 

"You have given Miss Smith all that she required," said he;
"you have made her graceful and easy.  She was a beautiful creature
when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have
added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature."

"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet
only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. 
She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness
in herself.  I have done very little."

"If it were admissible to contradict a lady," said the gallant
Mr. Elton--

"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,
have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her
way before."

"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.  So much superadded
decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!"

"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.  I never met with
a disposition more truly amiable."

"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort
of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. 
She was not less pleased another day with the manner
in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture. 

"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?" said she: "did
you ever sit for your picture?"

Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,
with a very interesting naivete,

"Oh! dear, no, never."

No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,

"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would
give any money for it.  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself. 
You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had
a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of
my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. 
But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. 
But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. 
It would be such a delight to have her picture!"

"Let me entreat you," cried Mr. Elton; "it would indeed be a delight!
Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a
talent in favour of your friend.  I know what your drawings are. 
How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in
specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston
some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?"

Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking
likenesses? You know nothing of drawing.  Don't pretend to be
in raptures about mine.  Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. 
"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe
I shall try what I can do.  Harriet's features are very delicate,
which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity
in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought
to catch."

"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I
have not a doubt of your success.  Pray, pray attempt it. 
As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words,
be an exquisite possession."

"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. 
She thinks so little of her own beauty.  Did not you observe her
manner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my
picture be drawn?'"

"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.  It was not lost on me. 
But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded."

Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest
pressing of both the others.  Emma wished to go to work directly,
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts
at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they
might decide together on the best size for Harriet.  Her many
beginnings were displayed.  Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,
pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. 
She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress
both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little
labour as she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;--and drew
in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;
and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she
would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of. 
She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist
or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,
or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher
than it deserved. 

There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;
her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there
been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions
would have been the same.  They were both in ecstasies.  A likeness
pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital. 

"No great variety of faces for you," said Emma.  "I had only my
own family to study from.  There is my father--another of my
father--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,
that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very
like therefore.  Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see. 
Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion. 
She would sit whenever I asked her.  There is my sister; and really
quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike. 
I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have
sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four
children that she would not be quiet.  Then, here come all my
attempts at three of those four children;--there they are,
Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,
and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so
eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no
making children of three or four years old stand still you know;
nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the
air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any
of mama's children ever were.  Here is my sketch of the fourth,
who was a baby.  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it
is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. 
He had nestled down his head most conveniently.  That's very like. 
I am rather proud of little George.  The corner of the sofa is very good. 
Then here is my last,"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman
in small size, whole-length-- "my last and my best--my brother,
Mr. John Knightley.  --This did not want much of being finished, when I
put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. 
I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I
had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I
were quite agreed in thinking it very like)--only too handsome--too
flattering--but that was a fault on the right side-- after
all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of--"Yes,
it was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice."
We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. 
It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I
could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised
over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in
Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing
any body again.  But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own,
and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present,
I will break my resolution now."

Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,
and was repeating, "No husbands and wives in the case at present
indeed, as you observe.  Exactly so.  No husbands and wives,"
with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider
whether she had not better leave them together at once.  But as she
wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer. 

She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. 
It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John
Knightley's, and was destined, if she could please herself,
to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece. 

The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid
of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet
mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. 
But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind
her and watching every touch.  She gave him credit for stationing
himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;
but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to
place himself elsewhere.  It then occurred to her to employ him
in reading. 

"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness
indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen
the irksomeness of Miss Smith's."

Mr. Elton was only too happy.  Harriet listened, and Emma drew
in peace.  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look;
any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;
and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,
to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no
being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration
made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible. 
She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance
were unexceptionable. 

The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite
enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. 
There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,
and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,
to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had
great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,
and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a
standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,
and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations
as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add. 

Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again. 

"By all means.  We shall be most happy to consider you as one
of the party."

The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,
took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress
of the picture, which was rapid and happy.  Every body who saw it
was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended
it through every criticism. 

"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she
wanted,"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting
that she was addressing a lover.--"The expression of the eye is
most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. 
It is the fault of her face that she has them not."

"Do you think so?" replied he.  "I cannot agree with you. 
It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. 
I never saw such a likeness in my life.  We must allow for the effect
of shade, you know."

"You have made her too tall, Emma," said Mr. Knightley. 

Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,

"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.  Consider,
she is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which
in short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must
be preserved, you know.  Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it
gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!"

"It is very pretty," said Mr. Woodhouse.  "So prettily done! Just
as your drawings always are, my dear.  I do not know any body who draws
so well as you do.  The only thing I do not thoroughly like is,
that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl
over her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold."

"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. 
Look at the tree."

"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."

"You, sir, may say any thing," cried Mr. Elton, "but I must confess
that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss
Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable
spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character. 
The naivete of Miss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is
most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.  I never saw such
a likeness."

The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a
few difficulties.  It must be done directly; it must be done in London;
the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,
must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse
could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs
of December.  But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,
than it was removed.  His gallantry was always on the alert. 
"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure
should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. 
It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being
employed on such an errand."

"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!-- she would
not give him such a troublesome office for the world,"--brought
on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and
a very few minutes settled the business. 

Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,
and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it
as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he
seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough. 

"What a precious deposit!" said he with a tender sigh, as he
received it. 

"This man is almost too gallant to be in love," thought Emma. 
"I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different
ways of being in love.  He is an excellent young man, and will suit
Harriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself;
but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more
than I could endure as a principal.  I come in for a pretty good
share as a second.  But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account."

CHAPTER VII

The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion
for Emma's services towards her friend.  Harriet had been at Hartfield,
as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home
to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been
talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. 
Half a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got
back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,
and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left
a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away;
and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two
songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;
and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct
proposal of marriage.  "Who could have thought it? She was so surprized
she did not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;
and a very good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote
as if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so,
she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she
should do.--" Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so
pleased and so doubtful. 

"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to lose
any thing for want of asking.  He will connect himself well if he can."

"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet.  "Pray do.  I'd rather
you would."

Emma was not sorry to be pressed.  She read, and was surprized. 
The style of the letter was much above her expectation. 
There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it
would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain,
was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much
to the credit of the writer.  It was short, but expressed good sense,
warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. 
She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for
her opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add,
"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?"

"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather slowly--"so
good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of
his sisters must have helped him.  I can hardly imagine the young
man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself
so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the
style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise;
not diffuse enough for a woman.  No doubt he is a sensible man,
and I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and
clearly--and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find
proper words.  It is so with some men.  Yes, I understand the sort
of mind.  Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point,
not coarse.  A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)
than I had expected."

"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;--" well--and-- and what
shall I do?"

"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard
to this letter?"

"Yes."

"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily."

"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."

"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.  You will
express yourself very properly, I am sure.  There is no danger of your
not being intelligible, which is the first thing.  Your meaning must
be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires,
will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded. 
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow
for his disappointment."

"You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking down. 

"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you
in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I
have been under a mistake.  I certainly have been misunderstanding
you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. 
I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."

Harriet was silent.  With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:

"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."

"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would
you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I
ought to do."

"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.  I will have nothing to
do with it.  This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."

"I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,
contemplating the letter.  For a little while Emma persevered
in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery
of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,

"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts
as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought
to refuse him.  If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say
`No' directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into
with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty
as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. 
But do not imagine that I want to influence you."

"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you
would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean
that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should
not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer
to say `No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'"

"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I advise
you either way.  You must be the best judge of your own happiness. 
If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him
the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should
you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you
at this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not
deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. 
At this moment whom are you thinking of?"

The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned
away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though
the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted
about without regard.  Emma waited the result with impatience,
but not without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation,
Harriet said--

"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must
do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined,
and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.  Do you
think I am right?"

"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just
what you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings
to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no
hesitation in approving.  Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. 
It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have
been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.  While you were in
the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would
not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. 
I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. 
Now I am secure of you for ever."

Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck
her forcibly. 

"You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast. 
"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. 
That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,
I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you
for any thing in the world."

"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;
but it must have been.  You would have thrown yourself out of all
good society.  I must have given you up."

"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed
me never to come to Hartfield any more!"

"Dear affectionate creature!--You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--You
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!
I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. 
He must have a pretty good opinion of himself."

"I do not think he is conceited either, in general," said Harriet,
her conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he is very good natured,
and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard
for-- but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,
though he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and
certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen
people--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners,
there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome and agreeable. 
However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man,
and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached
to me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you,
it is what I would not do upon any consideration."

"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not
be parted.  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked,
or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."

"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too."

Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a
"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the
clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,
to know that her husband could write a good letter."

"Oh! yes, very.  Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always
happy with pleasant companions.  I am quite determined to refuse him. 
But how shall I do? That shall I say?"

Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,
and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,
in the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest
against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the
formation of every sentence.  The looking over his letter again,
in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was
particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;
and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,
and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,
and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,
that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,
he would have been accepted after all. 

This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. 
The business was finished, and Harriet safe.  She was rather low
all the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets,
and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection,
sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton. 

"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in rather
a sorrowful tone. 

"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. 
You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared
to Abbey-Mill."

"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy
but at Hartfield."

Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be very
much surprized if she knew what had happened.  I am sure Miss Nash
would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,
and it is only a linen-draper."

"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the
teacher of a school, Harriet.  I dare say Miss Nash would envy you
such an opportunity as this of being married.  Even this conquest
would appear valuable in her eyes.  As to any thing superior for you,
I suppose she is quite in the dark.  The attentions of a certain
person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. 
Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks
and manners have explained themselves."

Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering
that people should like her so much.  The idea of Mr. Elton was
certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted
again towards the rejected Mr. Martin. 

"Now he has got my letter," said she softly.  "I wonder what they
are all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy,
they will be unhappy too.  I hope he will not mind it so very much."

"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more
cheerfully employed," cried Emma.  "At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton
is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much
more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five
or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."

"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street."

"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.  No, my dear
little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be
in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow.
It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight. 
It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them,
it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature,
eager curiosity and warm prepossession.  How cheerful, how animated,
how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!"

Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger. 

CHAPTER VIII

Harriet slept at Hartfield that night.  For some weeks past she
had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually
getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma
judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her
with them as much as possible just at present.  She was obliged
to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's,
but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield,
to make a regular visit of some days. 

While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with
Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up
his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it,
and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples
of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. 
Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering
by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted
apologies and civil hesitations of the other. 

"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you
will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take
Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.  As the sun
is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. 
I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.  We invalids think we
are privileged people."

"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."

"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.  Emma will be happy
to entertain you.  And therefore I think I will beg your excuse
and take my three turns--my winter walk."

"You cannot do better, sir."

"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,
but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;
and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey."

"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I
think the sooner you go the better.  I will fetch your greatcoat
and open the garden door for you."

Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being
immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined
for more chat.  He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking
of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before. 

"I cannot rate her beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a
pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of
her disposition.  Her character depends upon those she is with;
but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman."

"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."

"Come," said he, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will
tell you that you have improved her.  You have cured her of her
school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit."

"Thank you.  I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I
had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow
praise where they may.  You do not often overpower me with it."

"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"

"Almost every moment.  She has been gone longer already than
she intended."

"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps."

"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!"

"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would."

Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore
said nothing.  He presently added, with a smile,

"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you
that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon
hear of something to her advantage."

"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"

"A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling. 

"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love
with her? Who makes you their confidant?"

Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint. 
Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew
Mr. Elton looked up to him. 

"I have reason to think," he replied, "that Harriet Smith will
soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable
quarter:--Robert Martin is the man.  Her visit to Abbey-Mill,
this summer, seems to have done his business.  He is desperately
in love and means to marry her."

"He is very obliging," said Emma; "but is he sure that Harriet
means to marry him?"

"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came
to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. 
He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,
I believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask
me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;
whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his
choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being
considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in a line
of society above him.  I was very much pleased with all that he said. 
I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. 
He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very
well judging.  He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,
and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is
an excellent young man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation
in advising him to marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it;
and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. 
I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. 
If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought
highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the
best friend and counsellor man ever had.  This happened the night
before last.  Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not
appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should
be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,
without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch."

"Pray, Mr. Knightley," said Emma, who had been smiling to herself
through a great part of this speech, "how do you know that Mr. Martin
did not speak yesterday?"

"Certainly," replied he, surprized, "I do not absolutely know it;
but it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?"

"Come," said she, "I will tell you something, in return for what
you have told me.  He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,
and was refused."

This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;
and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,
as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,

"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. 
What is the foolish girl about?"

"Oh! to be sure," cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible
to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. 
A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her."

"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.  But what is
the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,
if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken."

"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer."

"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.  Emma, this is
your doing.  You persuaded her to refuse him."

"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should
not feel that I had done wrong.  Mr. Martin is a very respectable
young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am
rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her. 
By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.  It is
a pity that they were ever got over."

"Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;
and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, "No, he
is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense
as in situation.  Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. 
What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education,
to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural
daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision
at all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only
as parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl,
nor a girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful,
and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. 
At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,
is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. 
She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. 
My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being
beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that,
as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as
to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. 
But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing
to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort
of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led
aright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt
to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)
that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. 
Even your satisfaction I made sure of.  It crossed my mind immediately
that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the
sake of her being settled so well.  I remember saying to myself,
`Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a
good match.'"

"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say
any such thing.  What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all
his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate
friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying
a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I
wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings. 
I assure you mine are very different.  I must think your statement
by no means fair.  You are not just to Harriet's claims. 
They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;
Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly
her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves
is much above his.--It would be a degradation."

"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married
to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!"

"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense
she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. 
She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below
the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely
be a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of
fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged
for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter,
is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's daughters,
no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin."

"Whoever might be her parents," said Mr. Knightley, "whoever may
have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part
of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. 
After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in
Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short,
in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. 
Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was
good enough.  She desired nothing better herself.  Till you chose
to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set,
nor any ambition beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the
Martins in the summer.  She had no sense of superiority then. 
If she has it now, you have given it.  You have been no friend to
Harriet Smith, Emma.  Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far,
if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him. 
I know him well.  He has too much real feeling to address any
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion.  And as to conceit,
he is the farthest from it of any man I know.  Depend upon it he
had encouragement."

It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this
assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again. 

"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,
are unjust to Harriet.  Harriet's claims to marry well are not
so contemptible as you represent them.  She is not a clever girl,
but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not
deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly. 
Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you
describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in
the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations
to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,
and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred;
and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject
of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall
in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl,
with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired
and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,
consequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is not so very
slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness
of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great
readiness to be pleased with other people.  I am very much mistaken
if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper,
the highest claims a woman could possess."

"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,
is almost enough to make me think so too.  Better be without sense,
than misapply it as you do."

"To be sure!" cried she playfully.  "I know that is the feeling
of you all.  I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly
what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses
and satisfies his judgment.  Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. 
Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you. 
And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning
to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first
offer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her."

"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr. Knightley
presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now
perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. 
You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what
she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her
reach will be good enough for her.  Vanity working on a weak head,
produces every sort of mischief.  Nothing so easy as for a young lady
to raise her expectations too high.  Miss Harriet Smith may not find
offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. 
Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. 
Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves
with a girl of such obscurity-- and most prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in,
when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.  Let her marry
Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever;
but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach
her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence
and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's
all the rest of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a
girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate,
and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son."

"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,
that there can be no use in canvassing it.  We shall only be making
each other more angry.  But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin,
it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think,
as must prevent any second application.  She must abide by the evil
of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself,
I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little;
but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. 
His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad,
that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. 
I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,
she might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends,
and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen
nobody better (that must have been his great assistant)
she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. 
But the case is altered now.  She knows now what gentlemen are;
and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance
with Harriet."

"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!" cried Mr. Knightley.--"Robert
Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend
them; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand."

Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. 
She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself
a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he
could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment
in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her;
and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state,
was very disagreeable.  Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence,
with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather,
but he made no answer.  He was thinking.  The result of his thoughts
appeared at last in these words. 

"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I
hope it will not be long before he does.  Your views for Harriet
are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love
of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans,
and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you
that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain."

Emma laughed and disclaimed.  He continued,

"Depend upon it, Elton will not do.  Elton is a very good sort of man,
and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely
to make an imprudent match.  He knows the value of a good income
as well as any body.  Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will
act rationally.  He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you
can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,
and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way
of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,
I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away. 
I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family
of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all
twenty thousand pounds apiece."

"I am very much obliged to you," said Emma, laughing again. 
"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would
have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want
to keep Harriet to myself.  I have done with match-making indeed. 
I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.  I shall leave
off while I am well."

"Good morning to you,"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. 
He was very much vexed.  He felt the disappointment of the young man,
and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the
sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had
taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly. 

Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more
indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his.  She did not always
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that
her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. 
He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. 
She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little
time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. 
Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. 
The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's
that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,
gave alarming ideas.  The dread of such a failure after all became the
prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,
and without having any such reason to give for her long absence,
she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,
and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,
she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings
would not justify. 

He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered
that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,
neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,
in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such
an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it
hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather
said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew
any thing about.  He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak
with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not
be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;
he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;
but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence
of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley
saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;
but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any
hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;
and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very
sure did not belong to Mr. Elton. 

Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,
not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash
had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately
with great delight.  Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend
a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash,
that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met
Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was
actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till
the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been
never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him
about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,
to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off
his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been
determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed,
that he was going on business which he would not put off for any
inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission,
and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.  Mr. Perry
could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must
be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only
looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. 
Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more
about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,
"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be,
but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer,
she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt,
Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness."

CHAPTER IX

Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel
with herself.  He was so much displeased, that it was longer than
usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,
his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.  She was sorry,
but could not repent.  On the contrary, her plans and proceedings
were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general
appearances of the next few days. 

The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after
Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common
sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences
of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment
as her youth and sort of mind admitted.  Emma was soon perfectly
satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as
he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter. 

Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal
of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than
a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.
It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let
her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be
labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts;
and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present,
the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,
was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort
that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,
made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies. 

In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale
are not uncommon.  Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's,
had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken
the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help,
to get a great many more.  Emma assisted with her invention,
memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,
it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form
as well as quantity. 

Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,
and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. 
"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young-- he
wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time."
And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."

His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;
but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about
so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter. 

It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of
Highbury in general should be put under requisition.  Mr. Elton
was the only one whose assistance she asked.  He was invited
to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums
that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him
most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,
as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,
nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass
his lips.  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles;
and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled,
and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,

    My first doth affliction denote,
      Which my second is destin'd to feel
    And my whole is the best antidote
      That affliction to soften and heal.--

made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it
some pages ago already. 

"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?" said she;
"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be
easier to you."

"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind
in his life.  The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss
Woodhouse"--he stopt a moment-- "or Miss Smith could inspire him."

The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. 
He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the
table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had
addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which,
from his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own. 

"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said he. 
"Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree
to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."

The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma
could understand.  There was deep consciousness about him,
and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's.
He was gone the next moment:--after another moment's pause,

"Take it," said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards
Harriet--"it is for you.  Take your own."

But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma,
never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself. 

        To Miss--

          CHARADE. 

    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.
    Another view of man, my second brings,
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!

    But ah! united, what reverse we have!
      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;
    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. 

      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,
      May its approval beam in that soft eye!

She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through
again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then
passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,
while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion
of hope and dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. 
I have read worse charades.  Courtship--a very good hint.  I give
you credit for it.  This is feeling your way.  This is saying very
plainly-- `Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you. 
Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance.'

      May its approval beam in that soft eye!

Harriet exactly.  Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets,
the justest that could be given. 

      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply. 

Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better.  A man must be very much
in love, indeed, to describe her so.  Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish
you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you. 
For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. 
An excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose. 
Things must come to a crisis soon now."

She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the
eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions. 

"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I
cannot guess it in the least.  What can it possibly be? Do try
to find it out, Miss Woodhouse.  Do help me.  I never saw any thing
so hard.  Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could
be the young lady.  Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?

      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. 

Can it be Neptune?

      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!

Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only
one syllable.  It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. 
Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?"

"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you
thinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made
by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen. 

For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith. 

    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease. 

That is court. 

    Another view of man, my second brings;
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!

That is ship;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream. 

    But ah! united, (courtship, you know,) what reverse we have!
      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.
    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. 

A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application,
which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty
in comprehending.  Read it in comfort to yourself.  There can
be no doubt of its being written for you and to you."

Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. 
She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. 
She could not speak.  But she was not wanted to speak.  It was enough
for her to feel.  Emma spoke for her. 

"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,"
said she, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. 
You are his object-- and you will soon receive the completest proof
of it.  I thought it must be so.  I thought I could not be so deceived;
but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,
as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. 
Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance
to happen what has happened.  I could never tell whether an attachment
between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. 
Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each
other! I am very happy.  I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all
my heart.  This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride
in creating.  This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. 
It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence,
a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,
close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. 
This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either
of us."

"Dear Miss Woodhouse!"--and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all that Harriet,
with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they
did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently
clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered
just as she ought.  Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment. 

"Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and therefore
I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could
not have imagined it.  It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. 
Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions
about him.  He is so very superior.  Only think of those sweet
verses--"To Miss --------." Dear me, how clever!--Could it really
be meant for me?"

"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. 
It is a certainty.  Receive it on my judgment.  It is a sort
of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon
followed by matter-of-fact prose."

"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected.  I am sure,
a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do
take place!"

"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and
really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is
so evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement
of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form. 
You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong
to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes. 
Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.  There does
seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love
exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel
where it ought to flow. 

      The course of true love never did run smooth--

A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage."

"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,
who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,
the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body
looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after,
that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he
does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days
in the week.  And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down
all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury. 
Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little
did I think!-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and
peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss
Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;
however, she called me back presently, and let me look too,
which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked!
He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."

"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,
must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;
and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.  If they
are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose amiable
character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you
settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen
to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only
object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married,
here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment,
the rise in the world which must satisfy them."

"Yes, very true.  How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. 
You understand every thing.  You and Mr. Elton are one as clever
as the other.  This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth,
I could never have made any thing like it."

"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining
it yesterday."

"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read."

"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly."

"It is as long again as almost all we have had before."

"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. 
Such things in general cannot be too short."

Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear.  The most satisfactory
comparisons were rising in her mind. 

"It is one thing," said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--"to
have very good sense in a common way, like every body else,
and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,
and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write
verses and charades like this."

Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's prose. 

"Such sweet lines!" continued Harriet--"these two last!--But
how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found
it out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?"

"Leave it to me.  You do nothing.  He will be here this evening,
I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense
or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your
soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming.  Trust to me."

"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful
charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good."

"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you
should not write it into your book."

"Oh! but those two lines are"--

--"The best of all.  Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private
enjoyment keep them.  They are not at all the less written you know,
because you divide them.  The couplet does not cease to be, nor does
its meaning change.  But take it away, and all appropriation ceases,
and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. 
Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted,
much better than his passion.  A poet in love must be encouraged in
both capacities, or neither.  Give me the book, I will write it down,
and then there can be no possible reflection on you."

Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down
a declaration of love.  It seemed too precious an offering for any
degree of publicity. 

"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands," said she. 

"Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the longer
it lasts, the better I shall be pleased.  But here is my father
coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him. 
It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of
the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment. 
He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!-- You must
let me read it to him."

Harriet looked grave. 

"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this
charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are
too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning,
or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it. 
Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration. 
If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper
while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you. 
Do not let us be too solemn on the business.  He has encouragement
enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade."

"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.  Do as you please."

Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,
by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears,
how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?"

"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. 
A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt,
we suppose, by a fairy)-- containing a very pretty charade, and we
have just copied it in."

She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,
slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations
of every part as she proceeded-- and he was very much pleased, and,
as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion. 

"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. 
Very true.  `Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade,
my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.-- Nobody
could have written so prettily, but you, Emma."

Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking,
and a very tender sigh, he added,

"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother
was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I
can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you
have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza;
and there are several. 

    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,
      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,
    The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,
    Though of his near approach afraid,
      So fatal to my suit before. 

And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever
all the way through.  But I think, my dear, you said you had got it."

"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page.  We copied it
from the Elegant Extracts.  It was Garrick's, you know."

"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it. 

    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid. 

The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near
being christened Catherine after her grandmama.  I hope we shall
have her here next week.  Have you thought, my dear, where you
shall put her--and what room there will be for the children?"

"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always
has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual,
you know.  Why should there be any change?"

"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not
since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's
being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly
taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes,
not to see Miss Taylor here!"

"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."

"I do not know, my dear.  I am sure I was very much surprized
when I first heard she was going to be married."

"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella
is here."

"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she
is coming for only one week.  There will not be time for any thing."

"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case
of necessity.  Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th,
and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole
of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days
are not to be taken out for the Abbey.  Mr. Knightley promises
to give up his claim this Christmas-- though you know it is longer
since they were with him, than with us."

"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were
to be anywhere but at Hartfield."

Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on
his brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. 
He sat musing a little while, and then said,

"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back
so soon, though he does.  I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade
her to stay longer with us.  She and the children might stay very well."

"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish,
and I do not think you ever will.  Isabella cannot bear to stay
behind her husband."

This was too true for contradiction.  Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse
could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits
affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband,
she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them. 

"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while
my brother and sister are here.  I am sure she will be pleased
with the children.  We are very proud of the children, are not we,
papa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"

"Aye, I wonder which she will.  Poor little dears, how glad they
will be to come.  They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet."

"I dare say they are, sir.  I am sure I do not know who is not."

"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama.  Henry is the eldest,
he was named after me, not after his father.  John, the second,
is named after his father.  Some people are surprized, I believe,
that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry,
which I thought very pretty of her.  And he is a very clever boy,
indeed.  They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many
pretty ways.  They will come and stand by my chair, and say,
`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked me
for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. 
I think their father is too rough with them very often."

"He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so very
gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas,
you would not think him rough.  He wishes his boys to be active and hardy;
and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then;
but he is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley
is an affectionate father.  The children are all fond of him."

"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling
in a very frightful way!"

"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. 
It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down
the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way
to the other."

"Well, I cannot understand it."

"That is the case with us all, papa.  One half of the world cannot
understand the pleasures of the other."

Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate
in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero
of this inimitable charade walked in again.  Harriet turned away;
but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye
soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push--of
having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it
might turn up.  His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether
Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him,
or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield. 
If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend
Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him--had made
such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come. 

Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his
friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. 
He re-urged --she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make
his bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it--

"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;
thank you for the sight of it.  We admired it so much, that I have
ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection.  Your friend
will not take it amiss I hope.  Of course I have not transcribed
beyond the first eight lines."

Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. 
He looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about
"honour,"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book
open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. 
With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,

"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade
must not be confined to one or two.  He may be sure of every woman's
approbation while he writes with such gallantry."

"I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating
a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation in saying--at
least if my friend feels at all as I do--I have not the smallest
doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I see it,
(looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he
would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."

After this speech he was gone as soon as possible.  Emma could not
think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities,
there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt
to incline her to laugh.  She ran away to indulge the inclination,
leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share. 

CHAPTER X

Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather
to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise;
and on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor
sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.

Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane
leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street
of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode
of Mr. Elton.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,
and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,
an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it
could be.  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much
smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,
there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without
a slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma's remark was--

"There it is.  There go you and your riddle-book one of these days."--
Harriet's was--

"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow
curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."

"I do not often walk this way now," said Emma, as they proceeded,
"but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get
intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards
of this part of Highbury."

Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors
and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love,
with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.

"I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think
of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want
to inquire about of his housekeeper--no message from my father."

She pondered, but could think of nothing.  After a mutual silence
of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--

"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,
or going to be married! so charming as you are!"--

Emma laughed, and replied,

"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;
I must find other people charming--one other person at least. 
And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have
very little intention of ever marrying at all."

"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it."

"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,
to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)
is out of the question:  and I do not wish to see any such person. 
I would rather not be tempted.  I cannot really change for the better. 
If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it."

"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"--

"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. 
Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!
but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature;
and I do not think I ever shall.  And, without love, I am sure I
should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.  Fortune I
do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: 
I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their
husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect
to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always
right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."

"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"

"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I
thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--
so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--
and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,
I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced there never
can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."

"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"

"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is
poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! 
A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,
disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,
but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,
and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.  And the
distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common
sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income
has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper. 
Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,
and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. 
This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good
natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very
much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. 
Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe,
if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely
to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:  that is a
great charm."

"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself
when you grow old?"

"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great
many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be
more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.
Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then
as they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less,
I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.
And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,
which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which
is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall
be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,
to care about.  There will be enough of them, in all probability,
to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need. 
There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my
attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas
of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.  My nephews
and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me."

"Do you know Miss Bates's niece?  That is, I know you must have
seen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?"

"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes
to Highbury.  By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out
of conceit with a niece.  Heaven forbid! at least, that I should
ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,
as she does about Jane Fairfax.  One is sick of the very name
of Jane Fairfax.  Every letter from her is read forty times over;
her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she
does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair
of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month. 
I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death."

They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics
were superseded.  Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses
of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention
and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse. 
She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and
their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary
virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into
their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance
with as much intelligence as good-will.  In the present instance,
it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;
and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,
she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene
as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,

"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they
make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of
nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,
who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"

"Very true," said Harriet.  "Poor creatures! one can think
of nothing else."

"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,"
said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep
which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,
and brought them into the lane again.  "I do not think it will,"
stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,
and recall the still greater within.

"Oh! dear, no," said her companion.

They walked on.  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend
was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near
as to give Emma time only to say farther,

"Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability
in good thoughts.  Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that
if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,
it has done all that is truly important.  If we feel for the wretched,
enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,
only distressing to ourselves."

Harriet could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentleman
joined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,
were the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call
on them.  His visit he would now defer; but they had a very
interesting parley about what could be done and should be done. 
Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.

"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thought Emma;
"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase
of love on each side.  I should not wonder if it were to bring
on the declaration.  It must, if I were not here.  I wish I were
anywhere else."

Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised
on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. 
But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's
habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,
in short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;
she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration
to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete
occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,
and she would follow in half a minute.  They did as they were desired;
and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,
she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken
by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,
with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side
of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural
thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been
acting just then without design; and by this means the others were
still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her. 
She gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child's pace was quick,
and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,
from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them. 
Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very
pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning
to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both
looked around, and she was obliged to join them.

Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;
and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he
was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's
party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for
the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,
the beet-root, and all the dessert.

"This would soon have led to something better, of course," was her
consoling reflection; "any thing interests between those who love;
and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. 
If I could but have kept longer away!"

They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage
pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into
the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,
and fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace
off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently
obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to
put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.

"Part of my lace is gone," said she, "and I do not know how I am
to contrive.  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,
but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg
leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit
of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."

Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing
could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into
his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. 
The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,
and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately
communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed
into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most
comfortable manner.  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she
found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it. 
It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging
the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it
practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room. 
For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could
be protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished,
and make her appearance.

The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.  It had a
most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory
of having schemed successfully.  But it would not do; he had not
come to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful;
he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely
followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,
but nothing serious.

"Cautious, very cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by inch,
and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."

Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished
by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself
that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,
and must be leading them forward to the great event.

CHAPTER XI

Mr. Elton must now be left to himself.  It was no longer in Emma's
power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. 
The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand,
that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth
her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay
at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--
that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could
be afforded by her to the lovers.  They might advance rapidly
if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether
they would or no.  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them. 
There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will
do for themselves.

Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual
absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the
usual interest.  Till this year, every long vacation since their
marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;
but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing
for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had
been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all
by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,
even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most
nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.

He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a
little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to
bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms
were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,
and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent
number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. 
The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,
welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,
produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne
under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;
but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were
so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,
and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,
all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,
which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,
the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,
either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.

Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,
quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;
wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,
and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for
these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. 
She could never see a fault in any of them.  She was not a woman
of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance
of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;
was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,
had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield
in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.  They were alike too,
in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard
for every old acquaintance.

Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;
rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his
private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being
generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. 
He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross
as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his
great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,
it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not
be increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his. 
He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,
and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.

He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing
wrong in him escaped her.  She was quick in feeling the little
injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. 
Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been
flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly
kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;
but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her
regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes
fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father. 
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished. 
Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking
him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.
It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great
regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was
due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as
there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,
though the offence came not.  The beginning, however, of every visit
displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity
so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. 
They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,
with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's
attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.

"Ah, my dear," said he, "poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business."

"Oh yes, sir," cried she with ready sympathy, "how you must
miss her!  And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--
I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could
possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope
she is pretty well, sir."

"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know
but that the place agrees with her tolerably."

Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any
doubts of the air of Randalls.

"Oh! no--none in the least.  I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--
never looking so well.  Papa is only speaking his own regret."

"Very much to the honour of both," was the handsome reply.

"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella
in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.

Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."

"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since
they married.  Either in the morning or evening of every day,
excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,
and generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you
may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.  They are very,
very kind in their visits.  Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. 
Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving
Isabella a false idea of us all.  Every body must be aware that Miss
Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured
that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any
means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth."

"Just as it should be," said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as I hoped
it was from your letters.  Her wish of shewing you attention could
not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it
all easy.  I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea
of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;
and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."

"Why, to be sure," said Mr. Woodhouse--"yes, certainly--I cannot deny
that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--
but then--she is always obliged to go away again."

"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--
You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."

"I think, indeed," said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr. Weston
has some little claim.  You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part
of the poor husband.  I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,
the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. 
As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience
of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."

"Me, my love," cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--
"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,
a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been
for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought
of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;
and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think
there is nothing he does not deserve.  I believe he is one of the
very best-tempered men that ever existed.  Excepting yourself
and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.  I shall
never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day
last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September
twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,
I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor
a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be
Miss Taylor."

"Where is the young man?" said John Knightley.  "Has he been here
on this occasion--or has he not?"

"He has not been here yet," replied Emma.  "There was a strong
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended
in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."

"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said her father. 
"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,
and a very proper, handsome letter it was.  She shewed it to me. 
I thought it very well done of him indeed.  Whether it was his own idea
you know, one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--"

"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes."

"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--
and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!  Well,
time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.  However, it was
an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston
a great deal of pleasure.  I remember it was written from Weymouth,
and dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget
how it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'--
I remember that perfectly."

"How very pleasing and proper of him!" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John
Knightley.  "I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. 
But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! 
There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his
parents and natural home!  I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston
could part with him.  To give up one's child!  I really never
could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."

"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,"
observed Mr. John Knightley coolly.  "But you need not imagine
Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry
or John.  Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,
than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them,
and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect,
much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,
upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his
neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any
thing that home affords."

Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,
and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let
it pass.  She would keep the peace if possible; and there was
something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits,
the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's
disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,
and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.

CHAPTER XII

Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination
of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him
in Isabella's first day.  Emma's sense of right however had decided it;
and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,
she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late
disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him
the proper invitation.

She hoped they might now become friends again.  She thought it
was time to make up.  Making-up indeed would not do.  She certainly
had not been in the wrong, and he would never own that he had. 
Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear
to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather
assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room
she had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl
about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield,
and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms.  It did assist;
for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon
led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child
out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. 
Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving
her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness,
she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,

"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces. 
As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;
but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree."

"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men
and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your
dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,
we might always think alike."

"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being
in the wrong."

"Yes," said he, smiling--"and reason good.  I was sixteen years
old when you were born."

"A material difference then," she replied--"and no doubt you were
much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does
not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings
a good deal nearer?"

"Yes--a good deal nearer."

"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,
if we think differently."

"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.  Come, my dear Emma,
let us be friends, and say no more about it.  Tell your aunt, little Emma,
that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing
old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now."

"That's true," she cried--"very true.  Little Emma, grow up
a better woman than your aunt.  Be infinitely cleverer and not
half so conceited.  Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I
have done.  As far as good intentions went, we were both right,
and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet
proved wrong.  I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very,
very bitterly disappointed."

"A man cannot be more so," was his short, full answer.

"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me."

This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John
Knightley made his appearance, and "How d'ye do, George?" and "John,
how are you?" succeeded in the true English style, burying under
a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment
which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing
for the good of the other.

The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined
cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his
dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;
on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;
their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma
only occasionally joining in one or the other.

The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally
of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,
and who was always the greater talker.  As a magistrate, he had
generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,
some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand
the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear
next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail
of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been
the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong. 
The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree,
and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn,
was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his
cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever
left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached
a tone of eagerness.

While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying
a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.

"My poor dear Isabella," said he, fondly taking her hand,
and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one
of her five children--"How long it is, how terribly long since you
were here!  And how tired you must be after your journey!  You must
go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you
before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. 
My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel."

Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,
that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article
as herself;--and two basins only were ordered.  After a little
more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its
not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,
with an air of grave reflection,

"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn
at South End instead of coming here.  I never had much opinion
of the sea air."

"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we
should not have gone.  He recommended it for all the children,
but particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--
both sea air and bathing."

"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her
any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,
though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very
rarely of use to any body.  I am sure it almost killed me once."


When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;
and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made
her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she
had undervalued their strength.  It was a long, well-written letter,
giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,
expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was
natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local
that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. 
No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the
language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition
from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some
of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on
to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been
said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own
name was not wanting.  Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once,
and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a
compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said;
and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it
was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern
the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment
perhaps of all conveyed.  Compressed into the very lowest vacant
corner were these words--"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,
as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.  Pray make
my excuses and adieus to her."  This, Emma could not doubt, was all
for herself.  Harriet was remembered only from being her friend. 
His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor
better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,
and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for
coming to Randalls again.

Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the
material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up
and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth,
that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn
to do without her.  Her intentions were unchanged.  Her resolution
of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for
his subsequent consolation and happiness.  His recollection of Harriet,
and the words which clothed it, the "beautiful little friend,"
suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. 
Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his
inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with
the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner;
and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in
her favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.

"I must not dwell upon it," said she.--"I must not think of it. 
I know the danger of indulging such speculations.  But stranger
things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other
as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort
of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward
to with pleasure."

It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf,
though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil
in that quarter was at hand.  As Frank Churchill's arrival had
succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury,
as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now
upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were
assuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named. 
He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride. 
There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe
before "Mr. Elton and his bride" was in every body's mouth,
and Frank Churchill was forgotten.  Emma grew sick at the sound. 
She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;
and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately
gaining strength.  With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least,
there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;
but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state
of composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage,
bell-ringing, and all.

Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma
could give.  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her,
that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;
but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing
any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions
the same.  Harriet listened submissively, and said "it was very true--
it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to
think about them--and she would not think about them any longer"
but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour
saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before. 
At last Emma attacked her on another ground.

"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about
Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can
make me.  You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I
fell into.  It was all my doing, I know.  I have not forgotten it,
I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--
and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.  Do not imagine
me in danger of forgetting it."

Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words
of eager exclamation.  Emma continued,

"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,
talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,
I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important
than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration
of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour
to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit,
and restore your tranquillity.  These are the motives which I
have been pressing on you.  They are very important--and sorry
I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them. 
My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.  I want
you to save yourself from greater pain.  Perhaps I may sometimes
have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather
what would be kind by me."

This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. 
The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,
whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,
and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained
powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it
very tolerably.

"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--
Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody
as I do for you!--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!"

Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look
and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet
so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.

"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart," said she
afterwards to herself.  "There is nothing to be compared to it. 
Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,
will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction,
I am sure it will.  It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear
father so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--
I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is
my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives. 
Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,
longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.  Oh! the coldness
of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--And for a wife--
a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable.  I mention no names;
but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!"

CHAPTER XIV

Mrs. Elton was first seen at church:  but though devotion might
be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,
and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,
to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,
or not pretty at all.

Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,
to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;
and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of
the business might be gone through as soon as possible.

She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room
to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,
to lace up her boot, without recollecting.  A thousand vexatious
thoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;
and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be
recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather
pale and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so
much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma
would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,
and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms
of being "elegantly dressed, and very pleasing."

She did not really like her.  She would not be in a hurry to find fault,
but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--
She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,
there was too much ease.  Her person was rather good; her face
not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,
were elegant.  Emma thought at least it would turn out so.

As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would
not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. 
It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,
and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. 
The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,
and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own
good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly
unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with
the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,
and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him
to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,
and as little really easy as could be.

"Well, Miss Woodhouse," said Harriet, when they had quitted
the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;
"Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--
Is not she very charming?"

There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.

"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman."

"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."

"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."

"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love."

"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;
and she came in his way."

"I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say she
was very much attached to him."

"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the
woman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,
and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."

"Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well she might, nobody could ever
have a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,
Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. 
He is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,
it is quite a different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need
not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery. 
To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--
She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves. 
Happy creature!  He called her `Augusta.'  How delightful!"

When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.  She could then
see more and judge better.  From Harriet's happening not to be
at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton,
she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself,
and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite
convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well
satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;
that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which
had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her
notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;
that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would
certainly do Mr. Elton no good.

Harriet would have been a better match.  If not wise or refined herself,
she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,
it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best
of her own set.  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride
of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride
of him.

The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "My brother
Mr. Suckling's seat;"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. 
The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the
house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably
impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she
could see or imagine.  "Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite
struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size
of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room."--
Mr. Elton was appealed to.--"Was not it astonishingly like?--
She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove."

"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like
the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. 
I really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so
extremely partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy
months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,
undoubtedly.  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;
but to me, it has been quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted,
like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it
is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. 
I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."

Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient
for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.

"So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house--
the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly
like.  The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here,
and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;
and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,
which put me so exactly in mind!  My brother and sister will be
enchanted with this place.  People who have extensive grounds
themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style."

Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.  She had a great idea
that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little
for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth
while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said
in reply,

"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think
you have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties."

"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England,
you know.  Surry is the garden of England."

"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. 
Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,
as well as Surry."

"No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile."
I never heard any county but Surry called so."

Emma was silenced.

"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,
or summer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be
our time for exploring.  While they are with us, we shall explore
a great deal, I dare say.  They will have their barouche-landau,
of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying
any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different
beauties extremely well.  They would hardly come in their chaise,
I think, at that season of the year.  Indeed, when the time draws on,
I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;
it will be so very much preferable.  When people come into a beautiful
country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes
them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond
of exploring.  We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer,
in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the
barouche-landau.  You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,
Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"

"No; not immediately here.  We are rather out of distance of the very
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;
and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed
to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure."

"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. 
Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am.  I was quite
a proverb for it at Maple Grove.  Many a time has Selina said,
when she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl
to move from the house.  I absolutely must go in by myself, though I
hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;
but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir
beyond the park paling.'  Many a time has she said so; and yet I
am no advocate for entire seclusion.  I think, on the contrary,
when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very
bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in
a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. 
I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--
(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must
be a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. 
Let me recommend Bath to you.  I assure you I have no doubt of its doing
Mr. Woodhouse good."

"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving
any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown
to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be
useful now."

"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief
they give.  In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! 
And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of
use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes
much depressed.  And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy I
need not take much pains to dwell on them.  The advantages of Bath
to the young are pretty generally understood.  It would be a charming
introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could
immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. 
A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my
particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided
with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,
and would be the very person for you to go into public with."

It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. 
The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called
an introduction--of her going into public under the auspices
of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow,
who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--
The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!

She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could
have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; "but their going
to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly
convinced that the place might suit her better than her father." 
And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the
subject directly.

"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.  Upon these occasions,
a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long
known that you are a superior performer."

"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. 
A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you. 
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came. 
I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends
say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,
upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree. 
You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.  I assure you
it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,
to hear what a musical society I am got into.  I absolutely cannot
do without music.  It is a necessary of life to me; and having always
been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,
it would have been a most serious sacrifice.  I honestly said as much
to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing
his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;
and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been
accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension. 
When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the
world I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear
of retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,
the world was not necessary to me.  I could do very well without it. 
To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my
resources made me quite independent.  And as to smaller-sized rooms
than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought. 
I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description. 
Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I
did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,
nor were spacious apartments.  `But,' said I, `to be quite honest,
I do not think I can live without something of a musical society. 
I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank
to me.'"

"We cannot suppose," said Emma, smiling, "that Mr. Elton would hesitate
to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury;
and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than
may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive."

"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.  I am delighted
to find myself in such a circle.  I hope we shall have many sweet
little concerts together.  I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I
must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings
at your house, or ours.  Will not it be a good plan?  If we
exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies. 
Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me,
as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--
there is a sad story against them, in general.  They are but too apt
to give up music."

"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can
be no danger, surely?"

"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,
I tremble.  Selina has entirely given up music--never touches
the instrument--though she played sweetly.  And the same may be said
of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,
now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. 
Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.  I used to be
quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend
that a married woman has many things to call her attention. 
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper."

"But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon
be in so regular a train--"

"Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see."

Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,
had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton
chose another subject.

"We have been calling at Randalls," said she, "and found them
both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. 
I like them extremely.  Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--
quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you. 
And she appears so truly good--there is something so motherly
and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly. 
She was your governess, I think?"

Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton
hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.

"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her
so very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman."

"Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly good. 
Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest
model for any young woman."

"And who do you think came in while we were there?"

Emma was quite at a loss.  The tone implied some old acquaintance--
and how could she possibly guess?

"Knightley!" continued Mrs. Elton; "Knightley himself!--Was not
it lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day,
I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a
friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity.  `My friend Knightley'
had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;
and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not
be ashamed of his friend.  Knightley is quite the gentleman. 
I like him very much.  Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man."

Happily, it was now time to be gone.  They were off; and Emma
could breathe.

"Insufferable woman!" was her immediate exclamation.  "Worse than I
had supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!--I could not
have believed it.  Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,
and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! 
A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo,
and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and
underbred finery.  Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is
a gentleman!  I doubt whether he will return the compliment,
and discover her to be a lady.  I could not have believed it! 
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club! 
One would fancy we were bosom friends!  And Mrs. Weston!--
Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be
a gentlewoman!  Worse and worse.  I never met with her equal. 
Much beyond my hopes.  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. 
Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here? 
How angry and how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am--
thinking of him directly.  Always the first person to be thought of! 
How I catch myself out!  Frank Churchill comes as regularly into
my mind!"--

All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time
her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons'
departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable
of attending.

"Well, my dear," he deliberately began, "considering we never saw
her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say
she was very much pleased with you.  She speaks a little too quick. 
A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. 
But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks
like you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,
pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. 
Though I think he had better not have married.  I made the best
excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton
on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course
of the summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon
a bride is very remiss.  Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am! 
But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane."

"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.  Mr. Elton knows you."

"Yes:  but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects
to her if possible.  It was being very deficient."

"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore
why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride? 
It ought to be no recommendation to you.  It is encouraging people
to marry if you make so much of them."

"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would
always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,
especially, is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to her. 
A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,
let the others be who they may."

"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know
what is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your
sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."

"My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a
matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,
and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry."

Emma had done.  Her father was growing nervous, and could not
understand her.  Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences,
and long, very long, did they occupy her.

CHAPTER XV

Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill
opinion of Mrs. Elton.  Her observation had been pretty correct. 
Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview,
such she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming,
familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a
little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself
coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve
a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held
such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.

There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently
from his wife.  He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. 
He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such
a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;
and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,
or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's
good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever
and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied;
so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it
ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her
first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "very
pleasant and very elegantly dressed."

In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared
at first.  Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,
by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,
she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold
and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will
which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike. 
Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. 
They were sneering and negligent.  Emma hoped it must rapidly work
Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour
sunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor
Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,
and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable
to her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been
given also.  She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--
When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin
abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew
in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous
treatment of Harriet.

Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. 
Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be
supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she
was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--
but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting
to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,
and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's
knight-errantry on the subject.--

"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite
rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature.  So mild
and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she
has very extraordinary talents.  I do not scruple to say that she
plays extremely well.  I know enough of music to speak decidedly
on that point.  Oh! she is absolutely charming!  You will laugh at
my warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--
And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,
we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her. 
We must bring her forward.  Such talent as hers must not be suffered
to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of
the poet,

        `Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
          `And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'

We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."

"I cannot think there is any danger of it," was Emma's calm answer--
"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation
and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,
I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown."

"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,
such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have
enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!  And I think
she feels it.  I am sure she does.  She is very timid and silent. 
One can see that she feels the want of encouragement.  I like her
the better for it.  I must confess it is a recommendation to me. 
I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does
not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior,
it is extremely prepossessing.  Oh!  I assure you, Jane Fairfax
is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I
can express."

"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any
of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known
her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than"--

"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare
to act.  You and I need not be afraid.  If we set the example,
many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not
our situations.  We have carriages to fetch and convey her home,
and we live in a style which could not make the addition of
Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be
extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner,
as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax
to partake of it.  I have no idea of that sort of thing.  It is
not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to. 
My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the
other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. 
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--
for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling,
in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--
I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce
her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents,
and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. 
My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt
of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,
of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come
to us.  I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets
a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,
for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is
highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they
are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in
the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties."

"Poor Jane Fairfax!"--thought Emma.--"You have not deserved this. 
You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a
punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection
of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'  Heavens!  Let me
not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--
But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness
of that woman's tongue!"

Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively
addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a "dear Miss
Woodhouse."  The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,
and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular
friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very
active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a
general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.

She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for
Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless
simplicity and warmth.  She was quite one of her worthies--
the most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished
and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. 
Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept
those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. 
She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons,
spending a day with the Eltons!  This was astonishing!--She could not
have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax
could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.

"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!" said she.--"To chuse to remain
here month after month, under privations of every sort!  And now
to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury
of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions
who have always loved her with such real, generous affection."

Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells
were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells
had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer,
and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there. 
According to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had
written most pressingly.  Would Jane but go, means were to be found,
servants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed
to exist; but still she had declined it!

"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing
this invitation," was Emma's conclusion.  "She must be under some
sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. 
There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--
She is not to be with the Dixons.  The decree is issued by somebody. 
But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a
separate puzzle."

Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,
before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston
ventured this apology for Jane.

"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,
my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. 
Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion,
must be very tiresome.  We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,
before we condemn her taste for what she goes to."

"You are right, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "Miss Fairfax
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton. 
Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have
chosen her.  But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives
attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her."

Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;
and she was herself struck by his warmth.  With a faint blush,
she presently replied,

"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined,
would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton's
invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting."

"I should not wonder," said Mrs. Weston, "if Miss Fairfax were to have
been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness
in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her.  Poor Miss Bates may
very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater
appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated,
in spite of the very natural wish of a little change."

Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few
minutes silence, he said,

"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton
does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her.  We all know
the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest
spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond
common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--
a something more early implanted.  We cannot give any body the
disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before. 
We feel things differently.  And besides the operation of this,
as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes
Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that,
face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she
has a claim to.  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell
in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent
her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not
in consciousness."

"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax," said Emma. 
Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy
made her irresolute what else to say.

"Yes," he replied, "any body may know how highly I think of her."

"And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,
but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--
she hurried on--"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself
how highly it is.  The extent of your admiration may take you by
surprize some day or other."

Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick
leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together,
or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,

"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.  Mr. Cole
gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."

He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did
not herself know what to think.  In a moment he went on--

"That will never be, however, I can assure you.  Miss Fairfax,
I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very
sure I shall never ask her."

Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased
enough to exclaim,

"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.  I will say that for you."

He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner
which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,

"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?"

"No indeed I have not.  You have scolded me too much for match-making,
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.  What I said
just now, meant nothing.  One says those sort of things, of course,
without any idea of a serious meaning.  Oh! no, upon my word I have not
the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. 
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,
if you were married."

Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again.  The result of his reverie was,
"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will
ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way,
I assure you."  And soon afterwards, "Jane Fairfax is a very charming
young woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect.  She has a fault. 
She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife."

Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. 
"Well," said she, "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"

"Yes, very soon.  He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;
he asked my pardon and said no more.  Cole does not want to be wiser
or wittier than his neighbours."

"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser
and wittier than all the world!  I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--
what she calls them!  How can she find any appellation for them,
deep enough in familiar vulgarity?  She calls you, Knightley--what can
she do for Mr. Cole?  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane
Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her. 
Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.  I can much more
readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,
than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over
Mrs. Elton.  I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging herself
the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any
restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot
imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor
with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be
continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring
her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful
exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau."

"Jane Fairfax has feeling," said Mr. Knightley--"I do not
accuse her of want of feeling.  Her sensibilities, I suspect,
are strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,
patience, self-controul; but it wants openness.  She is reserved,
more reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an
open temper.  No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment,
it had never entered my head.  I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with
her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond."

"Well, Mrs. Weston," said Emma triumphantly when he left them,
"what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"

"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied
by the idea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder
if it were to end in his being so at last.  Do not beat me."

CHAPTER XVI

Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,
was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.  Dinner-parties and
evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations
flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending
they were never to have a disengaged day.

"I see how it is," said she.  "I see what a life I am to lead
among you.  Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. 
We really seem quite the fashion.  If this is living in the country,
it is nothing very formidable.  From Monday next to Saturday,
I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer
resources than I have, need not have been at a loss."

No invitation came amiss to her.  Her Bath habits made evening-parties
perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste
for dinners.  She was a little shocked at the want of two
drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being
no ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,
Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge
of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought
to be arranged.  In the course of the spring she must return their
civilities by one very superior party--in which her card-tables
should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs
in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening
than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round
the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.

Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner
at Hartfield for the Eltons.  They must not do less than others,
or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable
of pitiful resentment.  A dinner there must be.  After Emma had
talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,
and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom
of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding
who should do it for him.

The persons to be invited, required little thought.  Besides the Eltons,
it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--
and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must
be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given
with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly
pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. 
"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help. 
She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy
wife together, without feeling uncomfortable.  If Miss Woodhouse
would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home." 
It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it
possible enough for wishing.  She was delighted with the fortitude
of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give
up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the
very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--
Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,
she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had
often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her.  He had said
that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody
else paid her.

"This is very true," said she, "at least as far as relates to me,
which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--
and always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--
She will never like me now.  I have neglected her too long.  But I
will shew her greater attention than I have done."

Every invitation was successful.  They were all disengaged and all happy.--
The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over. 
A circumstance rather unlucky occurred.  The two eldest little
Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of
some weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them,
and staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be
the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did
not allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were
disturbed by its happening so.  Mr. Woodhouse considered eight
persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear--
and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would
be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even
to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.

She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,
by representing that though he certainly would make them nine,
yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be
very immaterial.  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself,
to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed
to her instead of his brother.

The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. 
John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town
and must be absent on the very day.  He might be able to join them
in the evening, but certainly not to dinner.  Mr. Woodhouse was quite
at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys
and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate,
removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.

The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley
seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable. 
Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited
for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton, as elegant
as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--
wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss
Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could
talk to her.  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning
from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning
to rain.  It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject,
and he said,

"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I
am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. 
I hope you turned directly."

"I went only to the post-office," said she, "and reached home
before the rain was much.  It is my daily errand.  I always fetch
the letters when I am here.  It saves trouble, and is a something
to get me out.  A walk before breakfast does me good."

"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."

"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."

Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,

"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six
yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you;
and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before. 
The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. 
When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are
never worth going through the rain for."

There was a little blush, and then this answer,

"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of
every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply
growing older should make me indifferent about letters."

"Indifferent!  Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent. 
Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very
positive curse."

"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters
of friendship."

"I have often thought them the worst of the two," replied he coolly. 
"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly
ever does."

"Ah! you are not serious now.  I know Mr. John Knightley too well--
I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as
any body.  I can easily believe that letters are very little to you,
much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than
myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. 
You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,
never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections,
a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out,
in worse weather than to-day."

"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,"
said John Knightley, "I meant to imply the change of situation
which time usually brings.  I consider one as including the other. 
Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within
the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. 
As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten
years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have."

It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.  A pleasant
"thank you" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,
a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. 
Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being,
according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of
his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,
was ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,

"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this
morning in the rain.  Young ladies should take care of themselves.--
Young ladies are delicate plants.  They should take care of their
health and their complexion.  My dear, did you change your stockings?"

"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind
solicitude about me."

"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--
I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.  They are some
of my very old friends.  I wish my health allowed me to be a
better neighbour.  You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. 
My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,
and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."

The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel
that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.

By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton,
and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.

"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office
in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,
how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there
to take care of you."

Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.

"Oh! do not tell me.  You really are a very sad girl, and do not
know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! 
Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?  You and I must positively
exert our authority."

"My advice," said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, "I certainly
do feel tempted to give.  Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--
Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought
to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year. 
The spring I always think requires more than common care. 
Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters,
than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.  Now do not you
feel that you had?  Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable. 
You look as if you would not do such a thing again."

"Oh! she shall not do such a thing again," eagerly rejoined
Mrs. Elton.  "We will not allow her to do such a thing again:"--
and nodding significantly--"there must be some arrangement made,
there must indeed.  I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches
our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name)
shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.  That will obviate
all difficulties you know; and from us I really think, my dear Jane,
you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation."

"You are extremely kind," said Jane; "but I cannot give up my
early walk.  I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can,
I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon
my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before."

"My dear Jane, say no more about it.  The thing is determined,
that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine
any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.  You know,
Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. 
But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely
worn out.  If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,
consider that point as settled."

"Excuse me," said Jane earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent
to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. 
If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it
always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's."

"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness
to employ our men."

Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead
of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.

"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!" said she.--
"The regularity and despatch of it!  If one thinks of all that it
has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"

"It is certainly very well regulated."

"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!  So seldom
that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing
about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,
I suppose, actually lost!  And when one considers the variety
of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,
it increases the wonder."

"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some
quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.  If you
want any farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are
paid for it.  That is the key to a great deal of capacity. 
The public pays and must be served well."

The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual
observations made.

"I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same
sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the
same master teaches, it is natural enough.  But for that reason,
I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,
for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble
into any hand they can get.  Isabella and Emma, I think, do write
very much alike.  I have not always known their writing apart."

"Yes," said his brother hesitatingly, "there is a likeness. 
I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest."

"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully," said Mr. Woodhouse;
"and always did.  And so does poor Mrs. Weston"--with half a sigh
and half a smile at her.

"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"--Emma began, looking also
at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was
attending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,
"Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking
his name at once before all these people?  Is it necessary
for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--
your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose,
if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his name without the
smallest distress.  I certainly get better and better.--Now for it."

Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--"Mr. Frank Churchill
writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."

"I do not admire it," said Mr. Knightley.  "It is too small--
wants strength.  It is like a woman's writing."

This was not submitted to by either lady.  They vindicated him
against the base aspersion.  "No, it by no means wanted strength--
it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. 
Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?"  No, she had
heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put
it away.

"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had my writing-desk,
I am sure I could produce a specimen.  I have a note of his.--
Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you
one day?"

"He chose to say he was employed"--

"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner
to convince Mr. Knightley."

"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,"
said Mr. Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,
he will, of course, put forth his best."

Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,
was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request
to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--

"Must I go first?  I really am ashamed of always leading the way."

Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma. 
She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know
whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.  She suspected
that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered
but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,
and that it had not been in vain.  She thought there was an air
of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.

She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition
and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--
but she abstained.  She was quite determined not to utter a word
that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed
the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance
of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.

CHAPTER XVII

When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found
it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--
with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton
engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.  She and Mrs. Weston were
obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together. 
Mrs. Elton left them no choice.  If Jane repressed her for a
little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed
between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,
there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: 
The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,
were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must
be at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had
yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of
Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.

"Here is April come!" said she, "I get quite anxious about you. 
June will soon be here."

"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked
forward to the summer in general."

"But have you really heard of nothing?"

"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."

"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware
of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."

"I not aware!" said Jane, shaking her head; "dear Mrs. Elton,
who can have thought of it as I have done?"

"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.  You do not
know how many candidates there always are for the first situations. 
I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. 
A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity
of applications; every body was anxious to be in her family,
for she moves in the first circle.  Wax-candles in the schoolroom! 
You may imagine how desirable!  Of all houses in the kingdom
Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you in."

"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,"
said Jane.  "I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will
want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. 
But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries
at present."

"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples.  You are afraid of giving
me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can
hardly be more interested about you than I am.  I shall write
to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict
charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible."

"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject
to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving
any body trouble."

"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,
and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business
to accomplish before us.  Your inexperience really amuses me! 
A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you,
is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice;
indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."

"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no
inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. 
When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid
of being long unemployed.  There are places in town, offices,
where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--
not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect."

"Oh! my dear, human flesh!  You quite shock me; if you mean a fling
at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather
a friend to the abolition."

"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade," replied Jane;
"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;
widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;
but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where
it lies.  But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices,
and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon
meeting with something that would do."

"Something that would do!" repeated Mrs. Elton.  "Aye, that may
suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature
you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up
with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,
in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command
the elegancies of life."

"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;
it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications,
I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison. 
A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for."

"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I
shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will
be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right
to move in the first circle.  Your musical knowledge alone would
entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,
and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--
if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure;
but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might,
even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must
and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before
the Campbells or I have any rest."

"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort
of such a situation together," said Jane, "they are pretty sure
to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing
to be attempted at present for me.  I am exceedingly obliged to you,
Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am
quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer. 
For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as
I am."

"And I am quite serious too, I assure you," replied Mrs. Elton gaily,
"in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends
to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."

In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing
till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change
of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,

"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his
gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature
he is;--I assure you I like him excessively.  I admire all that quaint,
old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;
modern ease often disgusts me.  But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,
I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.  Oh!  I assure
you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. 
I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. 
How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I
do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest
dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. 
I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. 
A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste
is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely
preferable to finery.  But I am quite in the minority, I believe;
few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery
are every thing.  I have some notion of putting such a trimming
as this to my white and silver poplin.  Do you think it will
look well?"

The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room
when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them.  He had returned
to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. 
He had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--
but there was great joy.  Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see
him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.  John Knightley
only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent
his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London,
should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house,
for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing
his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,
was a circumstance to strike him deeply.  A man who had been in motion
since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,
who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been
in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man,
to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside,
and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into
the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken
back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would
probably prolong rather than break up the party.  John Knightley
looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,
"I could not have believed it even of him."

Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation
he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all
the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere
from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest;
and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,
convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants
had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,
was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally
addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being
highly interesting to every body in the room.  He gave her a letter,
it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,
and had taken the liberty of opening it.

"Read it, read it," said he, "it will give you pleasure;
only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma."

The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling
and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued,
but very audible to every body.

"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.  Well, what do
you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon,
did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would
not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;
for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is
to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. 
As to her illness, all nothing of course.  But it is an excellent
thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town.  They will stay
a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us. 
This is precisely what I wanted.  Well, pretty good news, is not it? 
Have you finished it?  Has Emma read it all?  Put it up, put it up;
we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not
do now.  I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a
common way."

Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. 
Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them.  She was happy,
she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy. 
Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak
so fluently.  She was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,
and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she
rather thought was considerable.

Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative
to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,
and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.

It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he
might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley
particularly delighted.  They were the first entitled,
after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would
have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation
with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive
an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and
her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.

CHAPTER XVIII

"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,"
said Mr. Weston.

Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended
her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.

"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume," he continued--
"and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name."

"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. 
I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we
shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."

"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--
He is to be in town next week, if not sooner.  We have notice of it
in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,
and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed
to me--it was to Mrs. Weston.  She is his principal correspondent,
I assure you.  I hardly ever get a letter."

"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!  Oh!  Mr. Weston--
(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous
precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow
your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,
we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!  Mr. Weston,
I could not have believed it of you!"

"Aye, we men are sad fellows.  You must take care of yourself,
Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in
a hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all
coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has
not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--
so they are all to move southward without loss of time."

"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.  Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"

"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London. 
a considerable journey."

"Yes, upon my word, very considerable.  Sixty-five miles farther
than from Maple Grove to London.  But what is distance, Mr. Weston,
to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother,
Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.  You will hardly believe me--
but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again
with four horses."

"The evil of the distance from Enscombe," said Mr. Weston, "is, that
Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the
sofa for a week together.  In Frank's last letter she complained,
he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having
both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree
of weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she
means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word. 
Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions,
Mrs. Elton.  You must grant me that."

"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.  I Always take the part
of my own sex.  I do indeed.  I give you notice--You will find me
a formidable antagonist on that point.  I always stand up for women--
and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect
to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's
making incredible exertions to avoid it.  Selina says it is quite
horror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety. 
She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution. 
Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?"

"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other
fine lady ever did.  Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady
in the land for"--

Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,

"Oh!  Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.  Selina is no fine lady,
I assure you.  Do not run away with such an idea."

"Is not she?  Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is
as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."

Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. 
It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister
was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence
of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,
when Mr. Weston went on.

"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--
but this is quite between ourselves.  She is very fond of Frank,
and therefore I would not speak ill of her.  Besides, she is out of
health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been. 
I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much
faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness."

"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,
or to Clifton?"  "She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too
cold for her.  The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. 
She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever
was before, and she begins to want change.  It is a retired place. 
A fine place, but very retired."

"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say.  Nothing can stand more retired from
the road than Maple Grove.  Such an immense plantation all round it! 
You seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--
And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina
to enjoy that sort of seclusion.  Or, perhaps she may not have
resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. 
I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel
very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent
of society."

"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."

"So I remember to have heard.  He will find an addition to the
society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume
to call myself an addition.  But perhaps he may never have heard
of there being such a creature in the world."

This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,
and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,

"My dear madam!  Nobody but yourself could imagine such a
thing possible.  Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's
letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton."

He had done his duty and could return to his son.

"When Frank left us," continued he, "it was quite uncertain when we
might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. 
It has been completely unexpected.  That is, I always had a strong
persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something
favourable would turn up--but nobody believed me.  He and Mrs. Weston
were both dreadfully desponding.  `How could he contrive to come? 
And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare
him again?' and so forth--I always felt that something would happen
in our favour; and so it has, you see.  I have observed, Mrs. Elton,
in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,
they are sure to mend the next."

"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.  It is just what I used
to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,
when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all
the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair,
and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be May before
Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us.  Oh! the pains I have
been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! 
The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,
I remember, he came to me quite in despair."

She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly
seized the opportunity of going on.

"You were mentioning May.  May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill
is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place
than Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the
agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--
precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen
for it:  days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,
always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.  When he
was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal
of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know,
and we could not do half that we intended.  Now will be the time. 
This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,
whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant
expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,
and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having
him actually in the house.  I think it is so.  I think it is the
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.  I hope you
will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. 
He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. 
Mrs. Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,
most gratifying to me.  She thinks nobody equal to him."

"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my
opinion will be decidedly in his favour.  I have heard so much
in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair
to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,
and are by no means implicitly guided by others.  I give you notice
that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer."

Mr. Weston was musing.

"I hope," said he presently, "I have not been severe upon poor
Mrs. Churchill.  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;
but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult
for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. 
You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family,
nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves,
the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.  She was the instigator. 
Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her. 
Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's:
his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would
harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;
but her pride is arrogance and insolence!  And what inclines one less
to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.  She was nobody
when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever
since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them
all in high and mighty claims:  but in herself, I assure you, she is
an upstart."

"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!  I have quite
a horror of upstarts.  Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust
to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood
who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs
they give themselves!  Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me
think of them directly.  People of the name of Tupman, very lately
settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving
themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old
established families.  A year and a half is the very utmost that they can
have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. 
They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much,
you know, Mr. Weston.  One has not great hopes from Birmingham. 
I always say there is something direful in the sound:  but nothing
more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things
I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently
think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens
to be one of their nearest neighbours.  It is infinitely too bad. 
Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove,
and whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I am
almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before
his death."

They were interrupted.  Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,
having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of
walking away.

After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse
to cards.  The remaining five were left to their own powers,
and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed
little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,
which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself
in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.

Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. 
He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--

"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about
the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is
down at full length there we may be sure.  My charge would be much
more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit;
all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,
and do not physic them."

"I rather hope to satisfy you both," said Emma, "for I shall do all
in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella;
and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic."

"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."

"That is very likely.  You think so, do not you?"

"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--
or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements
continue to increase as much as they have done lately."

"Increase!"

"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made
a great difference in your way of life."

"Difference!  No indeed I am not."

"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company
than you used to be.  Witness this very time.  Here am I come
down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--
When did it happen before, or any thing like it?  Your neighbourhood
is increasing, and you mix more with it.  A little while ago,
every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;
dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown.  The difference
which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great."

"Yes," said his brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it all."

"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less
influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,
that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.  And if they are,
I only beg you to send them home."

"No," cried Mr. Knightley, "that need not be the consequence. 
Let them be sent to Donwell.  I shall certainly be at leisure."

"Upon my word," exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me!  I should like to know
how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being
of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure
to attend to the little boys.  These amazing engagements of mine--
what have they been?  Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball
talked of, which never took place.  I can understand you--(nodding at
Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of
your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. 
But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom
I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a
series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.  And as to my dear
little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them,
I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,
who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--
and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling
his accounts."

Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded
without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.

VOLUME III

CHAPTER I

A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the
nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. 
She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at
all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.  Her own attachment
had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--
but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love
of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment
which he had taken away, it would be very distressing.  If a separation
of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils
before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. 
She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,
and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.

She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. 
That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!
and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive. 
She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,
an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.

It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,
before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's
feelings.  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had
been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.  He rode
down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came
from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all
her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced,
and how she must act.  They met with the utmost friendliness. 
There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her. 
But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he
had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. 
She watched him well.  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he
had been.  Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference,
had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.

He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed
delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: 
and he was not without agitation.  It was not in his calmness that
she read his comparative difference.  He was not calm; his spirits
were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him. 
Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;
but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a
quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. 
"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--
he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he
had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,
and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off." 
She had no doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his
agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure;
and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her
returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself
with her long.

This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. 
He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. 
His aunt could not bear to have him leave her.  Such was his own account
at Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come,
it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had
been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. 
That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself
convinced of it, at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could
not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state
of health than she had been half a year ago.  He did not believe it
to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,
or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;
but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say
that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong
as ever.

It soon appeared that London was not the place for her.  She could
not endure its noise.  Her nerves were under continual irritation
and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to
Randalls communicated a change of plan.  They were going to remove
immediately to Richmond.  Mrs. Churchill had been recommended
to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise
a fancy for the place.  A ready-furnished house in a favourite
spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.

Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two
months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--
for the house was taken for May and June.  She was told that now
he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,
almost as often as he could even wish.

Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.  He was
considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. 
She hoped it was not so.  Two months must bring it to the proof.

Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable.  He was quite delighted. 
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for.  Now, it would
be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.  What were nine miles
to a young man?--An hour's ride.  He would be always coming over. 
The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough
to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing
him never.  Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen
to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.  Were he ever able
to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning. 
There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be
at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse. 
Better than nearer!

One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--
the ball at the Crown.  It had not been forgotten before, but it had
been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.  Now, however,
it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon
after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,
to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change,
and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four
hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.

Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing.  A very few to-morrows
stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.

Mr. Woodhouse was resigned.  The time of year lightened the evil
to him.  May was better for every thing than February.  Mrs. Bates
was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,
and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear
little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear
Emma were gone.

CHAPTER II

No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.  The day approached,
the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching,
Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls
before dinner, and every thing was safe.

No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. 
The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better
than a common meeting in a crowd.  Mr. Weston had been so very
earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible
after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the
propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,
that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet
interval in the young man's company.  She was to convey Harriet,
and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just
sufficiently before them.

Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though
he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have
a delightful evening.  They all walked about together, to see
that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes
were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma
could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. 
"So unreasonably early!" she was going to exclaim; but she presently
found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,
by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were
so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been
entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness,
on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might
soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.

Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which
Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and
intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes,
was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity. 
She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness
would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence,
but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--
She could fancy such a man.  The whole party walked about,
and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,
formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their
various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though May,
a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.

Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number
of privy councillors was not yet larger.  They had stopped
at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage,
but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.

Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,
which shewed a mind not at ease.  He was looking about, he was going
to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--
impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.

Mrs. Elton was spoken of.  "I think she must be here soon," said he. 
"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much
of her.  It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."

A carriage was heard.  He was on the move immediately;
but coming back, said,

"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.  I have never seen
either Mr. or Mrs. Elton.  I have no business to put myself forward."

Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.

"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about. 
"We thought you were to bring them."

The mistake had been slight.  The carriage was sent for them now. 
Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton
might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress,
and her smiles of graciousness.  He was immediately qualifying
himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention,
after the introduction had passed.

In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--
"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to his father: 
"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:"  and away he went.  Mr. Weston
was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her
opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young
man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out
of hearing.

"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.  You know I candidly told
you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am
extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.  I never compliment. 
I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely
what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least
conceit or puppyism.  You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--
quite a horror of them.  They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. 
Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we
used sometimes to say very cutting things!  Selina, who is mild almost
to a fault, bore with them much better."

While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;
but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were
ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must
hurry away.

Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.  "I have no doubt of its being
our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.  Our coachman and horses are
so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--
What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--
I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it
will be quite unnecessary.  You may be very sure I shall always
take care of them."

Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,
walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much
her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them.  Her gestures and
movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma;
but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the
incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not
finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted
into the circle at the fire.  As the door opened she was heard,

"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.  Nothing to signify. 
I do not care for myself.  Quite thick shoes.  And Jane declares--
Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!  This is brilliant
indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. 
Nothing wanting.  Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--
Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?  Oh!  Mr. Weston,
you must really have had Aladdin's lamp.  Good Mrs. Stokes
would not know her own room again.  I saw her as I came in;
she was standing in the entrance.  `Oh!  Mrs. Stokes,' said I--
but I had not time for more."  She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--
"Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. 
Very happy to hear it.  So afraid you might have a headach!--
seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have. 
Delighted to hear it indeed.  Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged
to you for the carriage!--excellent time.  Jane and I quite ready. 
Did not keep the horses a moment.  Most comfortable carriage.--
Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. 
Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--
But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours. 
I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma'am--.'  Thank you, my mother
is remarkably well.  Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take
her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--
Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother! 
Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice.  There were
three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. 
Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.  My dear Jane,
are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,
but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--
and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his
extreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you
my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet
never came out again.  My mother often talks of your good-nature.
Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--
Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?--
Very well I thank you, quite well.  This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--
Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma
most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,
you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--
She did it all herself.  Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--
No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--
and Mrs. Hughes.  Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for
a moment.--How do you do?  How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. 
This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--
Oh! there he is.  Don't disturb him.  Much better employed talking
to the young ladies.  How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the
other day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--
and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host
of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?  How do
you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.  Never better.--
Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the
worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about
among such friends!  And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted. 
No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea
if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes. 
Every thing so good!"

Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss
Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the
discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little
way behind her.--He was thoughtful.  Whether he were overhearing too,
she could not determine.  After a good many compliments to Jane
on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken,
Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--
and it was, "How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--
How has Wright done my hair?"--with many other relative questions,
all answered with patient politeness.  Mrs. Elton then said,
"Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such
an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me,
and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving
this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior
to others.  And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--
So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see
if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill. 
I like him very well."

At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could
not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want
to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while,
till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly
forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,

"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--
I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be
impatient for tidings of us."

"Jane!"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--
"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose."

"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.

"Not at all."

"You are ungrateful."

"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?"  Then changing from a frown to
a smile--"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--
Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?"

Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. 
He walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both
Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  He had met with them in a little perplexity,
which must be laid before Emma.  It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston
that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would
expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma
that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.

"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr. Weston. 
"She will think Frank ought to ask her."

Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise;
and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most
perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was
wanting him to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business
was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--
Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss
Woodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,
though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. 
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.  Mrs. Elton had
undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;
for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could
not lose by the change.  Mr. Weston might be his son's superior.--
In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment,
delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,
and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--
She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any
thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not
to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,
and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest
in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--
He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,
than where he had placed himself.  His tall, firm, upright figure,
among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,
was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her
own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men
who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike
a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he
but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him
to smile; but in general he was looking grave.  She wished he could
love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--
He seemed often observing her.  She must not flatter herself that he
thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,
she did not feel afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between
her and her partner.  They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,
than lovers.  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,
was indubitable.

The ball proceeded pleasantly.  The anxious cares, the incessant
attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.  Every body
seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,
which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,
was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this. 
Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive
than such meetings usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma
thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,
and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--
and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there
could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder
lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. 
He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: 
she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to
escape into the card-room.

Escape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room
where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about
in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution
of maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly
before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--
Emma saw it.  She was not yet dancing; she was working her way
up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,
and by only turning her head a little she saw it all.  When she was
half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she
would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,
that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took
place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,
who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,
but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,
gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, "Do not
you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his prompt reply was, "Most readily,
Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."

"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. 
I am no dancer."

"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have great pleasure,
I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man,
and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great
pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert."

"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady
disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith." 
"Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--
and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,
Mrs. Weston.  You will excuse me.  Any thing else I should be most happy
to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over."

Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what
surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat. 
This was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--
She looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a
little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation,
while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.

She would not look again.  Her heart was in a glow, and she feared
her face might be as hot.

In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley
leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized,
seldom more delighted, than at that instant.  She was all pleasure
and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be
thanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance
said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.

His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,
extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky,
if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for
the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction
which her happy features announced.  It was not thrown away on her,
she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle,
and was in a continual course of smiles.

Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)
very foolish.  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,
though growing very like her;--she spoke some of her feelings,
by observing audibly to her partner,

"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,
I declare."

Supper was announced.  The move began; and Miss Bates might be
heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being
seated at table and taking up her spoon.

"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. 
Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.  She says she is afraid
there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has
been done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane,
indeed you must.  Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! 
How well you put it on!--so gratified!  Excellent dancing indeed!--
Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama
to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without
saying a word, just as I told you.  Grandmama was quite well,
had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,
and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples
and wine before she came away:  amazing luck in some of her throws: 
and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,
and who were your partners.  `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane;
I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you
all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,
I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' 
My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would
not rather?--I am not helpless.  Sir, you are most kind.  Upon my word,
Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand
a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant
she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train. 
Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage. 
Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.  Oh! no, there is
but one.  Well, I was persuaded there were two.  How very odd! 
I was convinced there were two, and there is but one.  I never saw any
thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling
you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--
The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know;
but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus
brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the
asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.  Now there
is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--
so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it
to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse,
who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant! 
I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such
elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--
Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?  Anywhere, so that
Jane is not in a draught.  Where I sit is of no consequence. 
Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--
only it seems too good--but just as you please.  What you direct
in this house cannot be wrong.  Dear Jane, how shall we ever
recollect half the dishes for grandmama?  Soup too!  Bless me! 
I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I
cannot help beginning."

Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till
after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again,
her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. 
He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been
unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due
share of censure.

"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said he.  "Emma, why
is it that they are your enemies?"

He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving
no answer, added, "She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,
whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;
but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet."

"I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me."

He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,
and he only said,

"I shall not scold you.  I leave you to your own reflections."

"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever
tell me I am wrong?"

"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads
you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."

"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. 
There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I
did not:  and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. 
It was through a series of strange blunders!"

"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice
to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for
himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton
is totally without.  An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--
infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such
a woman as Mrs. Elton.  I found Harriet more conversable than I expected."

Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle
of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.

"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--
Come Emma, set your companions the example.  Every body is lazy! 
Every body is asleep!"

"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."

"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.

She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will
ask me."

"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.

"Indeed I will.  You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we
are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper."

"Brother and sister! no, indeed."

CHAPTER III

This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable
pleasure.  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball,
which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was
extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting
the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so
much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,
was peculiarly gratifying.  The impertinence of the Eltons, which for
a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been
the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked
forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--
From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they
quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.  It seemed as if her eyes
were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton
was not the superior creature she had believed him.  The fever
was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being
quickened again by injurious courtesy.  She depended on the evil
feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed
neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational,
Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not
wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!

She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.  He had told
her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping
at Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day. 
She did not regret it.

Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all
to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up
for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,
when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered
whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,
with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment
sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened. 
Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--
The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--
they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking
into a chair fainted away.

A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,
and surprizes be explained.  Such events are very interesting,
but the suspense of them cannot last long.  A few minutes made Emma
acquainted with the whole.

Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at
Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,
and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public
enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile
beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms
on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;
and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,
they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,
on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies. 
A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,
excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet
to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top,
and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury. 
But poor Harriet could not follow.  She had suffered very much
from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank
brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--
and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged
to remain.

How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been
more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack
could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a
dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,
and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and
more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out
her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,
or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,
and was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting,
and she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang,
demanding more.

In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling
and conditioning, they loud and insolent.  By a most fortunate
chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him
to her assistance at this critical moment.  The pleasantness
of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his
horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--
and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before
of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had
been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes: 
he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,
was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. 
The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet
was then their own portion.  He had left them completely frightened;
and Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,
had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits
were quite overcome.  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: 
he had thought of no other place.

This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and
of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--
He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays
left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give
assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there
being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,
he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter
for her friend and herself.

Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young
woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting
certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. 
So Emma thought, at least.  Could a linguist, could a grammarian,
could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their
appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling
that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting
to each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself,
be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such
a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.

It was a very extraordinary thing!  Nothing of the sort had ever
occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;
no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened
to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very
person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly
was very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she did, the favourable
state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more. 
He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,
she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.  It seemed as if
every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences. 
It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly
recommending each to the other.

In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him,
while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,
her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a
sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's
own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation
at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. 
Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled
nor assisted.  She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. 
No, she had had enough of interference.  There could be no harm
in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.  It was no more than a wish. 
Beyond it she would on no account proceed.

Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge
of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: 
but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.  Within half
an hour it was known all over Highbury.  It was the very event
to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all
the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of
frightful news.  The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies. 
Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,
would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go
beyond the shrubbery again.  It was some comfort to him that many
inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours
knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith,
were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure
of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--
which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,
and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. 
She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such
a man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not
invent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.

The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took
themselves off in a hurry.  The young ladies of Highbury might have
walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole
history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma
and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground,
and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of
Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right
if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.

CHAPTER IV

A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came
one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after
sitting down and hesitating, thus began:

"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I
should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then,
you know, it will be over."

Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. 
There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her,
quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.

"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," she continued,
"to have no reserves with you on this subject.  As I am happily
quite an altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you
should have the satisfaction of knowing it.  I do not want to say
more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way
as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."

"Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do."

"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . ." 
cried Harriet, warmly.  "It seems like madness!  I can see nothing
at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet
him or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--
and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do
not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her,
as I have done:  she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,
but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget
her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,
it will not give me another moment's pang:  and to convince you
that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I
ought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--
I know that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I
will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it
in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown. 
Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?" said she, with a conscious look.

"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?"

"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have
valued very much."

She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words Most
precious treasures on the top.  Her curiosity was greatly excited. 
Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. 
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,
which Harriet opened:  it was well lined with the softest cotton;
but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.

"Now," said Harriet, "you must recollect."

"No, indeed I do not."

"Dear me!  I should not have thought it possible you could forget
what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very
last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I
had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--
I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger
with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--
But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired
me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece;
but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept
playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me. 
And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--
so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then
as a great treat."

"My dearest Harriet!" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,
and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear. 
Remember it?  Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving
this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting
the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none
about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in
my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a
continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--
go on--what else?"

"And had you really some at hand yourself?  I am sure I never
suspected it, you did it so naturally."

"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!"
said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided
between wonder and amusement.  And secretly she added to herself,
"Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton
a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! 
I never was equal to this."

"Here," resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, "here is
something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable,
because this is what did really once belong to him, which the
court-plaister never did."

Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.  It was the end
of an old pencil,--the part without any lead.

"This was really his," said Harriet.--"Do not you remember
one morning?--no, I dare say you do not.  But one morning--I forget
exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before
that evening, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;
it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him
something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;
but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he
soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another,
and this was left upon the table as good for nothing.  But I kept
my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never
parted with it again from that moment."

"I do remember it," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it.--
Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we
liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. 
I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,
was not he?  I have an idea he was standing just here."

"Ah!  I do not know.  I cannot recollect.--It is very odd,
but I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember,
much about where I am now."--

"Well, go on."

"Oh! that's all.  I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--
except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,
and I wish you to see me do it."

"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness
in treasuring up these things?"

"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish
I could forget as easily as I can burn them.  It was very wrong
of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. 
I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them."

"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have
not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister
might be useful."

"I shall be happier to burn it," replied Harriet.  "It has
a disagreeable look to me.  I must get rid of every thing.--
There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton."

"And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?"

She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was
already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had
told no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a
fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,
and quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,
which made the information she received more valuable. 
She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, "Well, Harriet,
whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so"--and thought
no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet
say in a very serious tone, "I shall never marry."

Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a
moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,

"Never marry!--This is a new resolution."

"It is one that I shall never change, however."

After another short hesitation, "I hope it does not proceed from--
I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"

"Mr. Elton indeed!" cried Harriet indignantly.--"Oh! no"--and Emma
could just catch the words, "so superior to Mr. Elton!"

She then took a longer time for consideration.  Should she proceed
no farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--
Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;
or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive
Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing
like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent
discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--
She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,
all that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing was always best. 
She had previously determined how far she would proceed,
on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,
to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--
She was decided, and thus spoke--

"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. 
Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,
results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer,
would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. 
Is not it so?"

"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--
Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him
at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all
the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration,
which are so proper, in me especially."

"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet.  The service he rendered
you was enough to warm your heart."

"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--
The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--
when I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. 
Such a change!  In one moment such a change!  From perfect misery
to perfect happiness!"

"It is very natural.  It is natural, and it is honourable.--
Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--
But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise. 
I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.  I do not by any
means engage for its being returned.  Consider what you are about. 
Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: 
at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded
of his liking you.  Be observant of him.  Let his behaviour be the
guide of your sensations.  I give you this caution now, because I
shall never speak to you again on the subject.  I am determined
against all interference.  Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. 
Let no name ever pass our lips.  We were very wrong before;
we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there
do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;
but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have
been matches of greater disparity.  But take care of yourself. 
I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end,
be assured your raising your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste
which I shall always know how to value."

Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. 
Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing
for her friend.  Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--
and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.

CHAPTER V

In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened
upon Hartfield.  To Highbury in general it brought no material change. 
The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings,
and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax
was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells
from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,
fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,
provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity
in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful
situation against her will.

Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly
taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike
him more.  He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his
pursuit of Emma.  That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. 
Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints,
his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison;
words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. 
But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him
over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination
to trifle with Jane Fairfax.  He could not understand it; but there
were symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought so at least--
symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed,
he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning,
however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination. 
She was not present when the suspicion first arose.  He was dining
with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had
seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which,
from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. 
When he was again in their company, he could not help remembering
what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it
were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,

"Myself creating what I saw,"

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something
of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank
Churchill and Jane.

He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,
to spend his evening at Hartfield.  Emma and Harriet were going
to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a
larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their
exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston
and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met. 
They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it
was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,
pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.  The Randalls
party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech
from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it
possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.

As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. 
The gentlemen spoke of his horse.

"By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,
"what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"

Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that he
ever had any such plan."

"Nay, I had it from you.  You wrote me word of it three months ago."

"Me! impossible!"

"Indeed you did.  I remember it perfectly.  You mentioned it as
what was certainly to be very soon.  Mrs. Perry had told somebody,
and was extremely happy about it.  It was owing to her persuasion,
as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal
of harm.  You must remember it now?"

"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."

"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must
have dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith,
you walk as if you were tired.  You will not be sorry to find
yourself at home."

"What is this?--What is this?" cried Mr. Weston, "about Perry
and a carriage?  Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? 
I am glad he can afford it.  You had it from himself, had you?"

"No, sir," replied his son, laughing, "I seem to have had it
from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's
having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago,
with all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard
a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.  I am
a great dreamer.  I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--
and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin
dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry."

"It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have had such
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you
should be thinking of at Enscombe.  Perry's setting up his carriage!
and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--
just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;
only a little premature.  What an air of probability sometimes
runs through a dream!  And at others, what a heap of absurdities
it is!  Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in
your thoughts when you are absent.  Emma, you are a great dreamer,
I think?"

Emma was out of hearing.  She had hurried on before her guests
to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach
of Mr. Weston's hint.

"Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain
to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on this subject,
there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not
mean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes
the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,
I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;
for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles
knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret,
known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. 
Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came
to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she
had prevailed.  Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us
of it when we got home?  I forget where we had been walking to--
very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. 
Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do
not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;
she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not
to go beyond:  and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it
to a soul that I know of.  At the same time, I will not positively
answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do
sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.  I am a talker,
you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing
escape me which I should not.  I am not like Jane; I wish I were. 
I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world. 
Where is she?--Oh! just behind.  Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.--
Extraordinary dream, indeed!"

They were entering the hall.  Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded
Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.  From Frank Churchill's face,
where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,
he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind,
and too busy with her shawl.  Mr. Weston had walked in.  The two
other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.  Mr. Knightley
suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye--
he seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so--
Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.

There was no time for farther remark or explanation.  The dream must
be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round
the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,
and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and
persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke,
on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. 
Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.

"Miss Woodhouse," said Frank Churchill, after examining a table
behind him, which he could reach as he sat, "have your nephews taken
away their alphabets--their box of letters?  It used to stand here. 
Where is it?  This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought
to be treated rather as winter than summer.  We had great amusement
with those letters one morning.  I want to puzzle you again."

Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table
was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much
disposed to employ as their two selves.  They were rapidly forming
words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. 
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for
Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort,
which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily
occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure
of the "poor little boys," or in fondly pointing out, as he took
up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.

Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.  She gave
a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it. 
Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley
so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much
as he could, with as little apparent observation.  The word
was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.  If meant
to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight,
she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,
for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,
and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work. 
She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. 
The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,
there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not
otherwise ostensible.  Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream;
but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension. 
How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been
so lain asleep!  He feared there must be some decided involvement. 
Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn. 
These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. 
It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank
Churchill's part.

With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great
alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. 
He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look
sly and demure.  He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found
it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it
proper to appear to censure; for she said, "Nonsense! for shame!" 
He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,
"I will give it to her--shall I?"--and as clearly heard Emma
opposing it with eager laughing warmth.  "No, no, you must not;
you shall not, indeed."

It was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love
without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,
directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular
degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.  Mr. Knightley's
excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize
every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was
not long before he saw it to be Dixon.  Jane Fairfax's perception
seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal
to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters
so arranged.  She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing
herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her,
and saying only, "I did not know that proper names were allowed,"
pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked
resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. 
Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned
towards her aunt.

"Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though Jane had not
spoken a word--"I was just going to say the same thing.  It is time
for us to be going indeed.  The evening is closing in, and grandmama
will be looking for us.  My dear sir, you are too obliging. 
We really must wish you good night."

Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt
had preconceived.  She was immediately up, and wanting to quit
the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;
and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously
pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. 
She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was
looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion;
and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.

He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full
of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist
his observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--
an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. 
He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to
preserve her.  It was his duty.

"Pray, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what lay the great amusement,
the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? 
I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very
entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."

Emma was extremely confused.  She could not endure to give him the
true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,
she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.

"Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing;
a mere joke among ourselves."

"The joke," he replied gravely, "seemed confined to you
and Mr. Churchill."

He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.  She would
rather busy herself about any thing than speak.  He sat a little
while in doubt.  A variety of evils crossed his mind.  Interference--
fruitless interference.  Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy,
seemed to declare her affection engaged.  Yet he would speak. 
He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in
an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter
any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.

"My dear Emma," said he at last, with earnest kindness, "do you
think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between
the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"

"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?  Oh! yes, perfectly.--
Why do you make a doubt of it?"

"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,
or that she admired him?"

"Never, never!" she cried with a most open eagerness--"Never, for
the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. 
And how could it possibly come into your head?"

"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--
certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."

"Oh! you amuse me excessively.  I am delighted to find that you
can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--
very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will
not do.  There is no admiration between them, I do assure you;
and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some
peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--
it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of
nonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,
which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or
admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be. 
That is, I presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its
being so on his.  I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."

She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction
which silenced, Mr. Knightley.  She was in gay spirits, and would
have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars
of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows
of a circumstance which highly entertained her:  but his gaiety did
not meet hers.  He found he could not be useful, and his feelings
were too much irritated for talking.  That he might not be irritated
into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender
habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon
afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness
and solitude of Donwell Abbey.

CHAPTER VI

After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and
Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. 
No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores
at present.  In the daily interchange of news, they must be again
restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'
coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,
whose health seemed every day to supply a different report,
and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped
might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child,
as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.

Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed.  It was the delay of a great
deal of pleasure and parade.  Her introductions and recommendations
must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. 
So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced
her that every thing need not be put off.  Why should not they
explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?  They could
go there again with them in the autumn.  It was settled that they
should go to Box Hill.  That there was to be such a party had been
long generally known:  it had even given the idea of another. 
Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body
found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.  Two or three more
of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to
be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior
to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking,
and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.

This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could
not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing
from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her
brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,
and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded
to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.  Now, as her
objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,
of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth
bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof
to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found
herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she
would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would
probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of
Mrs. Elton's party!  Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance
of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity
in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.

"I am glad you approve of what I have done," said he very comfortably. 
"But I thought you would.  Such schemes as these are nothing
without numbers.  One cannot have too large a party.  A large party
secures its own amusement.  And she is a good-natured woman after all. 
One could not leave her out."

Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.

It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton
was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston
as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw
every thing into sad uncertainty.  It might be weeks, it might be
only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations
could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. 
Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.

"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?" she cried.--"And such weather
for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. 
What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,
and nothing done.  Before this time last year I assure you we had
had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."

"You had better explore to Donwell," replied Mr. Knightley. 
"That may be done without horses.  Come, and eat my strawberries. 
They are ripening fast."

If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,
for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the "Oh!  I should
like it of all things," was not plainer in words than manner. 
Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for
the invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have
been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. 
She promised him again and again to come--much oftener than
he doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy,
such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.

"You may depend upon me," said she.  "I certainly will come. 
Name your day, and I will come.  You will allow me to bring
Jane Fairfax?"

"I cannot name a day," said he, "till I have spoken to some others
whom I would wish to meet you."

"Oh! leave all that to me.  Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am
Lady Patroness, you know.  It is my party.  I will bring friends
with me."

"I hope you will bring Elton," said he:  "but I will not trouble
you to give any other invitations."

"Oh! now you are looking very sly.  But consider--you need not be afraid
of delegating power to me.  I am no young lady on her preferment. 
Married women, you know, may be safely authorised.  It is my party. 
Leave it all to me.  I will invite your guests."

"No,"--he calmly replied,--"there is but one married woman in the world
whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell,
and that one is--"

"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose," interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.

"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage
such matters myself."

"Ah! you are an odd creature!" she cried, satisfied to have no
one preferred to herself.--"You are a humourist, and may say what
you like.  Quite a humourist.  Well, I shall bring Jane with me--
Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you.  I have no objections
at all to meeting the Hartfield family.  Don't scruple.  I know
you are attached to them."

"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call
on Miss Bates in my way home."

"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. 
It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. 
I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets
hanging on my arm.  Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. 
Nothing can be more simple, you see.  And Jane will have such another. 
There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.  We are
to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,
and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide,
it is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. 
Every thing as natural and simple as possible.  Is not that your idea?"

"Not quite.  My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have
the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity
of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think
is best observed by meals within doors.  When you are tired of eating
strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."

"Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out.  And, by the bye,
can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--
Pray be sincere, Knightley.  If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,
or to inspect anything--"

"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."

"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper
is extremely clever."

"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,
and would spurn any body's assistance."

"I wish we had a donkey.  The thing would be for us all to come
on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. 
I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.  In a country
life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have
ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut
up at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust,
and in winter there is dirt."

"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. 
Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.  Come on
a donkey, however, if you prefer it.  You can borrow Mrs. Cole's.
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."

"That I am sure you would.  Indeed I do you justice, my good friend. 
Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the
warmest heart.  As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--
Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention
to me in the whole of this scheme.  You have hit upon the very thing
to please me."

Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. 
He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;
and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors
to eat would inevitably make him ill.  Mr. Woodhouse must not,
under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two
spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.

He was invited on good faith.  No lurking horrors were to upbraid
him for his easy credulity.  He did consent.  He had not been
at Donwell for two years.  "Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,
and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with
Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens. 
He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of
the day.  He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,
and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other
of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his,
and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. 
He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--
very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not
fond of dining out."

Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. 
The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,
like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular
compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high
expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,
promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof
of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--
Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad
to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,
and spare no arguments to induce him to come.

In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party
to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell
was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather
appearing exactly right.

Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse
was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down,
to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most
comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a
fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease,
ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise
every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--
Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,
and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others
were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.

It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she
was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him,
and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with
more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house
and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.

She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance
with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant,
as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building,
its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--
its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream,
of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect,
had scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,
which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house
was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good
deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,
and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,
and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect
for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,
untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John
Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. 
She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could
raise a blush.  These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about
and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,
and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,
excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;
and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet
and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering,
accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries,
could now be thought or spoken of.--"The best fruit in England--
every body's favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds
and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one's self--the only way
of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired--
every sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--
the others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--
white wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--
abundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to
be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--
gardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--
only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--
currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries
the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--
must go and sit in the shade."

Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only
once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her
son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--
She had some fears of his horse.

Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged
to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--
A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.  Mrs. Elton
had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. 
It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge,
but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:  it was
with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,
a lady known at Maple Grove.  Delightful, charming, superior,
first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton
was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side,
all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused
to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued
to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,
repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--
Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence
by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing
to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,
with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--
"Should not they walk?  Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--
all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent."--The pertinacity
of her friend seemed more than she could bear.

It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,
dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly
followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short
avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal
distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--
It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone
wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,
to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had
been there.  Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such
a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view
which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly
the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper
form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank
of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--
and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,
rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river
making a close and handsome curve around it.

It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.  English verdure,
English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,
without being oppressive.

In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;
and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley
and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. 
Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was
glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned
her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony. 
Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.  There had been a time
also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot
so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not. 
It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity
and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,
and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall,
and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. 
He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. 
and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, "These are my
own concerns.  I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being
suspected of introducing Robert Martin."--She did not suspect him. 
It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think
of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade
was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of
the day.

The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--
and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did
not come.  Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.  His father would
not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could
not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare. 
He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty. 
"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting
over to them."--Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready
to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint
her nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston
was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be
by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--
Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;
she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.

The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more
to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;
perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting
on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,
and growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken
his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no
damps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more;
and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston
might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety
which her spirits seemed to need.

Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's
entertainment.  Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,
corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets,
had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning;
and the kindness had perfectly answered.  Mr. Woodhouse had been
exceedingly well amused.  Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him,
and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other
resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw,
for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking
over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake
of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot
of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,
coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--
Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start
at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.

"Will you be so kind," said she, "when I am missed, as to say
that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware
how late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we
shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said
nothing about it to any body.  It would only be giving trouble
and distress.  Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. 
Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,
will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"

"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk
to Highbury alone?"

"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast.  I shall be at home
in twenty minutes."

"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. 
Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. 
It can be round in five minutes."

"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--
And for me to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have
to guard others!"

She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,
"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. 
I must order the carriage.  The heat even would be danger.--You are
fatigued already."

"I am,"--she answered--"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort
of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all
know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.  Mine, I confess,
are exhausted.  The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let
me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary."

Emma had not another word to oppose.  She saw it all; and entering
into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately,
and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.  Her parting
look was grateful--and her parting words, "Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,
the comfort of being sometimes alone!"--seemed to burst from
an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual
endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who
loved her best.

"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said Emma, as she turned back
into the hall again.  "I do pity you.  And the more sensibility
you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."

Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only
accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank
Churchill entered the room.  Emma had not been thinking of him,
she had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him. 
Mrs. Weston would be at ease.  The black mare was blameless;
they were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. 
He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her;
a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given
up every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot
a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,
he believed he should not have come at all.  The heat was excessive;
he had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid
at home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold,
etc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest
possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire,
looking very deplorable.

"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still," said Emma.

"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.  I could very
ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming! 
You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. 
I met one as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!"

Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being
out of humour.  Some people were always cross when they were hot. 
Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating
and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints,
she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance
of every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out
the door.

"No--he should not eat.  He was not hungry; it would only make
him hotter."  In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;
and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.  Emma returned
all her attention to her father, saying in secret--

"I am glad I have done being in love with him.  I should not like a
man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning.  Harriet's sweet
easy temper will not mind it."

He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came
back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,
like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest
in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he
should be so late.  He was not in his best spirits, but seemed
trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense
very agreeably.  They were looking over views in Swisserland.

"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he. 
"I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. 
You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour
to read--or my poem.  I shall do something to expose myself."

"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.  You will
never go to Swisserland.  Your uncle and aunt will never allow
you to leave England."

"They may be induced to go too.  A warm climate may be prescribed
for her.  I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. 
I assure you I have.  I feel a strong persuasion, this morning,
that I shall soon be abroad.  I ought to travel.  I am tired
of doing nothing.  I want a change.  I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,
whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--
and would leave it to-morrow, if I could."

"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.  Cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"

"I sick of prosperity and indulgence!  You are quite mistaken. 
I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.  I am
thwarted in every thing material.  I do not consider myself at all
a fortunate person."

"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. 
Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. 
Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,
will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us."

"No--I shall not stir.  I shall sit by you.  You are my best cure."

"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. 
It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young
man so much in want of a change.  You will stay, and go with us?"

"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."

"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."

"No--It will not be worth while.  If I come, I shall be cross."

"Then pray stay at Richmond."

"But if I do, I shall be crosser still.  I can never bear to think
of you all there without me."

"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. 
Chuse your own degree of crossness.  I shall press you no more."

The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected. 
With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill;
others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress
and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. 
That it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with
a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. 
Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased
so much, that his last words to Emma were,

"Well;--if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will."

She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from
Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.

CHAPTER VII

They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward
circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality,
were in favour of a pleasant party.  Mr. Weston directed the whole,
officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every
body was in good time.  Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates
and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. 
Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting
but to be happy when they got there.  Seven miles were travelled
in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration
on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there
was deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union,
which could not be got over.  They separated too much into parties. 
The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss
Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill. 
And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.  It seemed
at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. 
Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,
and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours
that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation,
between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any
cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.

At first it was downright dulness to Emma.  She had never seen Frank
Churchill so silent and stupid.  He said nothing worth hearing--
looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without
knowing what she said.  While he was so dull, it was no wonder that
Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.

When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,
for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object. 
Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her. 
To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he
cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,
was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,
the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first
and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now,
in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most
people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English
word but flirtation could very well describe.  "Mr. Frank Churchill
and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively."  They were laying
themselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off
in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. 
Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;
it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected. 
She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him
for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,
admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning
back her heart.  She still intended him for her friend.

"How much I am obliged to you," said he, "for telling me to come to-day!--
If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the
happiness of this party.  I had quite determined to go away again."

"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,
except that you were too late for the best strawberries. 
I was a kinder friend than you deserved.  But you were humble. 
You begged hard to be commanded to come."

"Don't say I was cross.  I was fatigued.  The heat overcame me."

"It is hotter to-day."

"Not to my feelings.  I am perfectly comfortable to-day."

"You are comfortable because you are under command."

"Your command?--Yes."

"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,
somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your
own management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot
be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your
own command rather than mine."

"It comes to the same thing.  I can have no self-command without
a motive.  You order me, whether you speak or not.  And you can
be always with me.  You are always with me."

"Dating from three o'clock yesterday.  My perpetual influence
could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much
out of humour before."

"Three o'clock yesterday!  That is your date.  I thought I had seen
you first in February."

"Your gallantry is really unanswerable.  But (lowering her voice)--
nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be
talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people."

"I say nothing of which I am ashamed," replied he, with lively impudence. 
"I saw you first in February.  Let every body on the Hill hear me if
they can.  Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking
on the other.  I saw you first in February."  And then whispering--
"Our companions are excessively stupid.  What shall we do to rouse them? 
Any nonsense will serve.  They shall talk.  Ladies and gentlemen,
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides)
to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?"

Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal;
Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding;
Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.

"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are
all thinking of?"

"Oh! no, no"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--
"Upon no account in the world.  It is the very last thing I
would stand the brunt of just now.  Let me hear any thing rather
than what you are all thinking of.  I will not say quite all. 
There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)
whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing."

"It is a sort of thing," cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,
"which I should not have thought myself privileged to
inquire into.  Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party--
I never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--"

Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured,
in reply,

"Very true, my love, very true.  Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard of--
but some ladies say any thing.  Better pass it off as a joke. 
Every body knows what is due to you."

"It will not do," whispered Frank to Emma; "they are most
of them affronted.  I will attack them with more address. 
Ladies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she
waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of,
and only requires something very entertaining from each of you,
in a general way.  Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she
is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only
demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose
or verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--
or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily
at them all."

"Oh! very well," exclaimed Miss Bates, "then I need not be uneasy. 
`Three things very dull indeed.'  That will just do for me, you know. 
I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open
my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured
dependence on every body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?"

Emma could not resist.

"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty.  Pardon me--but you
will be limited as to number--only three at once."

Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not
immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could
not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.

"Ah!--well--to be sure.  Yes, I see what she means, (turning to
Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.  I must make
myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing
to an old friend."

"I like your plan," cried Mr. Weston.  "Agreed, agreed.  I will do
my best.  I am making a conundrum.  How will a conundrum reckon?"

"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low," answered his son;--"but we shall
be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way."

"No, no," said Emma, "it will not reckon low.  A conundrum of
Mr. Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour.  Come, sir,
pray let me hear it."

"I doubt its being very clever myself," said Mr. Weston. 
"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters
of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?"

"What two letters!--express perfection!  I am sure I do not know."

"Ah! you will never guess.  You, (to Emma), I am certain, will
never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?"

Understanding and gratification came together.  It might be a very
indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh
at and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem
to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid
about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,

"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston
has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every
body else.  Perfection should not have come quite so soon."

"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused," said Mrs. Elton;
"I really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. 
I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not
at all pleased with.  I knew who it came from.  An abominable puppy!--
You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things
are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;
but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring
about the country in summer.  Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. 
I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service. 
I do not pretend to be a wit.  I have a great deal of vivacity
in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak
and when to hold my tongue.  Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill. 
Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.  We have nothing clever to say--
not one of us.

"Yes, yes, pray pass me," added her husband, with a sort of
sneering consciousness; "I have nothing to say that can entertain
Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.  An old married man--
quite good for nothing.  Shall we walk, Augusta?"

"With all my heart.  I am really tired of exploring so long
on one spot.  Come, Jane, take my other arm."

Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. 
"Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out
of hearing:--"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as
they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only
knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!  Peculiarly lucky!--
for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath,
or any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be
no knowledge.  It is only by seeing women in their own homes,
among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form
any just judgment.  Short of that, it is all guess and luck--
and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself
on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!"

Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her
own confederates, spoke now.

"Such things do occur, undoubtedly."--She was stopped by a cough. 
Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.

"You were speaking," said he, gravely.  She recovered her voice.

"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances
do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them
to be very frequent.  A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--
but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.  I would
be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters,
(whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)
who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience,
an oppression for ever."

He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon
afterwards said, in a lively tone,

"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever
I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.  Will you?
(turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I
should like any body fixed on by you.  You provide for the family,
you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me. 
I am in no hurry.  Adopt her, educate her."

"And make her like myself."

"By all means, if you can."

"Very well.  I undertake the commission.  You shall have a charming wife."

"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes.  I care for nothing else. 
I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return,
I shall come to you for my wife.  Remember."

Emma was in no danger of forgetting.  It was a commission to touch every
favourite feeling.  Would not Harriet be the very creature described? 
Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished. 
He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;
who could say?  Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.

"Now, ma'am," said Jane to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs. Elton?"

"If you please, my dear.  With all my heart.  I am quite ready. 
I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. 
We shall soon overtake her.  There she is--no, that's somebody else. 
That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--
Well, I declare--"

They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. 
Mr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young
man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.  Even Emma grew
tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather
walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone,
and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful
views beneath her.  The appearance of the servants looking out
for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;
and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,
and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first,
were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was
to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. 
Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,
she hoped never to be betrayed into again.

While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. 
He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,

"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: 
a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still
use it.  I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. 
How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?  How could you be so
insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--
Emma, I had not thought it possible."

Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.

"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it. 
It was not so very bad.  I dare say she did not understand me."

"I assure you she did.  She felt your full meaning.  She has talked
of it since.  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--
with what candour and generosity.  I wish you could have heard her
honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions,
as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father,
when her society must be so irksome."

"Oh!" cried Emma, "I know there is not a better creature in the world: 
but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are
most unfortunately blended in her."

"They are blended," said he, "I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,
I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous
over the good.  Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every
harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner.  Were she your equal in situation--
but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.  She is poor;
she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live
to old age, must probably sink more.  Her situation should secure
your compassion.  It was badly done, indeed!  You, whom she had known
from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her
notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,
and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before
her niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly some,)
would be entirely guided by your treatment of her.--This is not
pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me;
but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,
and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice
than you can do now."

While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage;
it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. 
He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,
and her tongue motionless.  They were combined only of anger
against herself, mortification, and deep concern.  She had not
been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back
for a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken
no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness,
she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference;
but it was just too late.  He had turned away, and the horses were
in motion.  She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,
with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,
and every thing left far behind.  She was vexed beyond what could
have been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal. 
Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance
in her life.  She was most forcibly struck.  The truth of this
representation there was no denying.  She felt it at her heart. 
How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!  How could
she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! 
And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,
of concurrence, of common kindness!

Time did not compose her.  As she reflected more, she seemed
but to feel it more.  She never had been so depressed.  Happily it
was not necessary to speak.  There was only Harriet, who seemed not
in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma
felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,
without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.

CHAPTER VIII

The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all
the evening.  How it might be considered by the rest of the party,
she could not tell.  They, in their different homes, and their different
ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it
was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational
satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection,
than any she had ever passed.  A whole evening of back-gammon with
her father, was felicity to it.  There, indeed, lay real pleasure,
for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four
to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree
of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her
general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.  As a daughter,
she hoped she was not without a heart.  She hoped no one could
have said to her, "How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--
I must, I will tell you truths while I can."  Miss Bates should
never again--no, never!  If attention, in future, could do away
the past, she might hope to be forgiven.  She had been often remiss,
her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought
than fact; scornful, ungracious.  But it should be so no more. 
In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the
very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side,
of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.

She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,
that nothing might prevent her.  It was not unlikely, she thought,
that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might
come in while she were paying her visit.  She had no objection. 
She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly
and truly hers.  Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she
saw him not.

"The ladies were all at home."  She had never rejoiced at the sound
before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,
with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation,
or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.

There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking. 
She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry;
the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased
to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon.  The aunt and
niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.  Jane she had
a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door
had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, "Well, my dear,
I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are
ill enough."

Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she
did not quite understand what was going on.

"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said she, "but I do not know;
they tell me she is well.  I dare say my daughter will be here presently,
Miss Woodhouse.  I hope you find a chair.  I wish Hetty had not gone. 
I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where
you like?  I am sure she will be here presently."

Emma seriously hoped she would.  She had a moment's fear of Miss
Bates keeping away from her.  But Miss Bates soon came--"Very happy
and obliged"--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the
same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. 
A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead
the way to a return of old feelings.  The touch seemed immediate.

"Ah!  Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--
and are come to give us joy.  This does not seem much like joy,
indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be
very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long,
and she has a dreadful headach just now, writing all the morning:--
such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,
and Mrs. Dixon.  `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'--
for tears were in her eyes perpetually.  One cannot wonder,
one cannot wonder.  It is a great change; and though she is
amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman
before ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful,
Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing
her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache
she has.  When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel
any blessing quite as it may deserve.  She is as low as possible. 
To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she
is to have secured such a situation.  You will excuse her not
coming to you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room--
I want her to lie down upon the bed.  `My dear,' said I, `I shall
say you are laid down upon the bed:'  but, however, she is not;
she is walking about the room.  But, now that she has written
her letters, she says she shall soon be well.  She will be extremely
sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will
excuse her.  You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--
but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we
had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did
not know any body was coming.  `It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I,
`depend upon it.  Nobody else would come so early.'  `Well,' said she,
`it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' 
But then Patty came in, and said it was you.  `Oh!' said I,
`it is Miss Woodhouse:  I am sure you will like to see her.'--
`I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away;
and that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry
and ashamed we were.  `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must,
and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'"

Emma was most sincerely interested.  Her heart had been long growing
kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing
but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle
sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very
naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,
when she might not bear to see herself.  She spoke as she felt,
with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the
circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually
determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage
and comfort as possible.  "It must be a severe trial to them all. 
She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return."

"So very kind! " replied Miss Bates.  "But you are always kind."

There was no bearing such an "always;" and to break through her
dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--

"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?"

"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have
the charge of her three little girls--delightful children. 
Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort;
if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's;
but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very
same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove. 
Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove."

"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--"

"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton.  The most indefatigable, true friend. 
She would not take a denial.  She would not let Jane say, `No;' for
when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,
the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,
she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the
reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind
to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing
should induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she
told Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more
idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton,
whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.  It is not
every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did,
and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she
would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;
she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all
settled that Jane should go.  Quite a surprize to me!  I had not
the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,
that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation,
she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word
of it till it was all settled."

"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?"

"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come.  It was settled so,
upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. 
`You must all spend your evening with us,' said she--`I positively must
have you all come.'"

"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?"

"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I
thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let
him off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,
and a very agreeable evening we had.  Such kind friends, you know,
Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body
seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.  Even pleasure,
you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed
very much to have enjoyed it.  However, I shall always think it
a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends
who included me in it."

"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been
making up her mind the whole day?"

"I dare say she had."

"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all
her friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation
that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family."

"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.  Yes, indeed, there is every thing
in the world that can make her happy in it.  Except the Sucklings
and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment,
so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. 
Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost
equal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little
Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet
children anywhere.  Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--
It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!--
I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse. 
Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that
so much could be given to a young person like Jane."

"Ah! madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what I
remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount
of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions,
dearly earned."

"You are so noble in your ideas!"

"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"

"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. 
Within a fortnight.  Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry.  My poor
mother does not know how to bear it.  So then, I try to put it out of
her thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more."

"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel
and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself
before their return?"

"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such
a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. 
I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying
to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating
me upon it!  It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea,
because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea,
because I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it;
something happened before tea, but not that.  Mr. Elton was called
out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak
with him.  Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk
to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is
bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--
I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she
gets out at all.  And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton
about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself,
you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing
of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;
and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler
had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having
been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. 
That was what happened before tea.  It was after tea that Jane spoke
to Mrs. Elton."

Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly
new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it
possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars
of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all,
it was of no consequence.

What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the
accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge
of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over
from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--
which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected;
and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,
upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only
wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;
but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,
without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,
Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the
ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,
and driving very steady.

There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,
and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject
which already engaged her mind.  The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's
importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was
every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference
of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,
till roused by Miss Bates's saying,

"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.  What is to become
of that?--Very true.  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--
`You must go,' said she.  `You and I must part.  You will have no
business here.--Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroom
till Colonel Campbell comes back.  I shall talk about it to him;
he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--
And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his
present or his daughter's."

Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance
of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,
that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been
long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could
venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.

CHAPTER IX

Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;
but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. 
Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were
sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a
manner decidedly graver than usual, said,

"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,
and therefore must now be gone directly.  I am going to London,
to spend a few days with John and Isabella.  Have you any thing to
send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?"

"Nothing at all.  But is not this a sudden scheme?"

"Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time."

Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. 
Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be
friends again.  While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--
her father began his inquiries.

"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you
find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must
have been very much obliged to you for coming.  Dear Emma has been
to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. 
She is always so attentive to them!"

Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,
and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--
It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,
as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all that had
passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--
He looked at her with a glow of regard.  She was warmly gratified--
and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of
more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--
whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--
she might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand,
pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--
when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel
such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done,
she could not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought,
if he had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable;
and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,
or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--
It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--
She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction. 
It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--
gone in a moment.  He always moved with the alertness of a mind which
could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden
than usual in his disappearance.

Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished
she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great
pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--
Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,
for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have
happened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it,
would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however;
she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance,
and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she
had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them
half an hour, she found.  It was a pity that she had not come
back earlier!

In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness
of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly;
and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;
Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence
on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--
interested, without disturbing him.  He had long made up his mind to Jane
Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,
but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.

"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so
comfortably settled.  Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,
and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought
to be.  I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health
will be taken good care of.  It ought to be a first object,
as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.  You know,
my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor
was to us.  And I hope she will be better off in one respect,
and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long."

The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every
thing else into the background.  An express arrived at Randalls
to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!  Though her nephew
had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account,
she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return. 
A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded
by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle. 
The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.

It was felt as such things must be felt.  Every body had a
degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,
solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time,
curiosity to know where she would be buried.  Goldsmith tells us,
that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do
but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally
to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,
after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of
with compassionate allowances.  In one point she was fully justified. 
She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.  The event
acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness
of imaginary complaints.

"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal: 
more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try
the temper.  It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults,
what would Mr. Churchill do without her?  Mr. Churchill's loss
would be dreadful indeed.  Mr. Churchill would never get over it."--
Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,
"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his
mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing
and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense,
true and steady.  How it would affect Frank was among the earliest
thoughts of both.  It was also a very early speculation with Emma. 
The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind
glanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested
with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event,
how benefited, how freed.  She saw in a moment all the possible good. 
Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. 
Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody;
an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew. 
All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form
the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel
no certainty of its being already formed.

Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.
What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.  Emma was
gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance. 
They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.

Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating
all that was immediately important of their state and plans. 
Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their
first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire,
was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom
Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years. 
At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes
for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.

It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,
whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose
engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished
to shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. 
She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;
and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now
the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of
regard or sympathy.  She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew
a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration. 
She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield. 
A note was written to urge it.  The invitation was refused, and by
a verbal message.  "Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;"
and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning,
it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,
though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering
under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made
him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the
time proposed.  Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--
appetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely
alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,
which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was
uneasy about her.  He thought she had undertaken more than she
was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would
not own it.  Her spirits seemed overcome.  Her present home,
he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--
confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise--
and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge
to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description. 
Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact,
only too great.  He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more
evil than good from them.  Emma listened with the warmest concern;
grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover
some way of being useful.  To take her--be it only an hour
or two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,
and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two,
might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say,
in the most feeling language she could command, that she would
call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--
mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour
of such exercise for his patient.  The answer was only in this
short note:

"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal
to any exercise."

Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it
was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality
shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she
might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. 
In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove
to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--
but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude,
and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of
the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--
but all in vain.  Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;
Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out
seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her,
and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish,
Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on
no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.  "Indeed, the truth was,
that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--
Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made
such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them,
Jane would really see nobody."

Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,
and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;
neither could she feel any right of preference herself--
she submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther
as to her niece's appetite and diet, which she longed to be able
to assist.  On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy,
and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--
Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could
command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.

Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an
examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality
was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. 
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks
from Miss Bates, but "dear Jane would not be satisfied without its
being sent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover,
she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing."

When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering
about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon
of the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal
to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in
the carriage, she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--
that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her.  She was sorry,
very sorry.  Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed
but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits,
inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified
her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed
so little worthy as a friend:  but she had the consolation of knowing
that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself,
that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts
of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,
he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.

CHAPTER X

One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease,
Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay
five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her."--
He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,
in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,
unheard by her father,

"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it
be possible.  Mrs. Weston wants to see you.  She must see you."

"Is she unwell?"

"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.  She would have
ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone,
and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?"

"Certainly.  This moment, if you please.  It is impossible to
refuse what you ask in such a way.  But what can be the matter?--
Is she really not ill?"

"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.  You will know it
all in time.  The most unaccountable business!  But hush, hush!"

To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. 
Something really important seemed announced by his looks;
but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,
and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,
she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on
their way at a quick pace for Randalls.

"Now,"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--
"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."

"No, no,"--he gravely replied.--"Don't ask me.  I promised my wife
to leave it all to her.  She will break it to you better than I can. 
Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."

"Break it to me," cried Emma, standing still with terror.--
"Good God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened
in Brunswick Square.  I know it has.  Tell me, I charge you tell
me this moment what it is."

"No, indeed you are mistaken."--

"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest
friends are now in Brunswick Square.  Which of them is it?--
I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment."

"Upon my word, Emma."--

"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,
that it has nothing to do with any of them?  Good Heavens!--What can
be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?"

"Upon my honour," said he very seriously, "it does not.  It is not
in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name
of Knightley."

Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.

"I was wrong," he continued, "in talking of its being broke to you. 
I should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern you--
it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short,
my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. 
I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might
be much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."

Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. 
She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,
and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some
money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable
nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late
event at Richmond had brought forward.  Her fancy was very active. 
Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--
This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. 
It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.

"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" said she, as they proceeded--
speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with
any other view.

"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank,
I assure you.  You will not see him.  He is half way to Windsor
by this time."

"Has your son been with you, then?"

"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind."

For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more
guarded and demure,

"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did."

They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--"Well, my dear,"
said he, as they entered the room--"I have brought her, and now
I hope you will soon be better.  I shall leave you together. 
There is no use in delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me."--
And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he
quitted the room,--"I have been as good as my word.  She has not the
least idea."

Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,
that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,
she eagerly said,

"What is it my dear friend?  Something of a very unpleasant nature,
I find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. 
I have been walking all this way in complete suspense.  We both
abhor suspense.  Do not let mine continue longer.  It will do you
good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be."

"Have you indeed no idea?" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice. 
"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you
are to hear?"

"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."

"You are right.  It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;"
(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)
"He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. 
It is impossible to express our surprize.  He came to speak to his
father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--"

She stopped to breathe.  Emma thought first of herself, and then
of Harriet.

"More than an attachment, indeed," resumed Mrs. Weston; "an engagement--
a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any
body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax
are engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!"

Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,

"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?"

"You may well be amazed," returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,
and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--
"You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been a solemn
engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,
and kept a secret from every body.  Not a creature knowing it
but themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--
It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,
it is yet almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.--
I thought I knew him."

Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between
two ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;
and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,
and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.

"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is a
circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I
can at all comprehend it.  What!--engaged to her all the winter--
before either of them came to Highbury?"

"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me,
Emma, very much.  It has hurt his father equally.  Some part
of his conduct we cannot excuse."

Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend
not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,
be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,
as you are apprehensive of."

Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance
was as steady as her words.

"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my
present perfect indifference," she continued, "I will farther tell you,
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,
when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be
attached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease,
is perhaps the wonder.  Fortunately, however, it did cease. 
I have really for some time past, for at least these three months,
cared nothing about him.  You may believe me, Mrs. Weston. 
This is the simple truth."

Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could
find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done
her more good than any thing else in the world could do.

"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said she. 
"On this point we have been wretched.  It was our darling wish that you
might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--
Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."

"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of
grateful wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit him,
Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. 
What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,
and with manners so very disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour
to please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with
persevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged
to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--
How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--
very wrong, very wrong indeed."

"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--"

"And how could she bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!
to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,
before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,
which I can neither comprehend nor respect."

"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said
so expressly.  He had not time to enter into much explanation. 
He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation
which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--
but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said. 
The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;
and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the
impropriety of his conduct."

"Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. 
Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how
it has sunk him in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!--
None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth
and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man
should display in every transaction of his life."

"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been
wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer
for his having many, very many, good qualities; and--"

"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.--"Mrs. Smallridge, too! 
Jane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he
mean by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself--
to suffer her even to think of such a measure!"

"He knew nothing about it, Emma.  On this article I can fully
acquit him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated
to him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--
Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. 
They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--
and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project
of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it
all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,
put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been
carrying on so long."

Emma began to listen better.

"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston.  "He told me
at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. 
Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations. 
It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are
not to be understood.  Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in
a hurry to condemn him.  Let us have patience.  I must love him;
and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,
I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready
to hope that it may.  They must both have suffered a great deal
under such a system of secresy and concealment."

"His sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have done
him much harm.  Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"

"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely
a difficulty.  Conceive what the events of a week have done
in that family!  While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there
could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely
are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is
persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. 
What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--
He gave his consent with very little persuasion."

"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for Harriet."

"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light
this morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy,
some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get
back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,
that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--
He was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made
him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen
him before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of
finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--
and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."

"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on
with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none
of them know of the engagement?"

Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.

"None; not one.  He positively said that it had been known to no
being in the world but their two selves."

"Well," said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled
to the idea, and I wish them very happy.  But I shall always
think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been
but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--
To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;
and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been,
the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves
all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the
midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting
in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both
to hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each
other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"

"I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston.  "I am
very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,
which both might not have heard."

"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,
when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."

"True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss
Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;
and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe."

At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,
evidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited
him in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma,
let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his
heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. 
Let us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may
be fairly said in her favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify;
but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it
may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,
that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness
of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--
and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this
one great deviation from the strict rule of right.  And how much
may be said in her situation for even that error!"

"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly.  "If a woman can ever
be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation
like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the
world is not their's, nor the world's law.'"

She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,
exclaiming,

"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! 
This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,
and exercise my talent of guessing.  But you really frightened me. 
I thought you had lost half your property, at least.  And here,
instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one
of congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,
on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished
young women in England for your daughter."

A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was
as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits
was immediate.  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: 
he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered
on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted
time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. 
His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,
or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all
over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,
in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,
and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could
possibly have done.

CHAPTER XI

"Harriet, poor Harriet!"--Those were the words; in them lay the
tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted
the real misery of the business to her.  Frank Churchill had behaved
very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much
his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him. 
It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account,
that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second
time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.  Mr. Knightley
had spoken prophetically, when he once said, "Emma, you have been
no friend to Harriet Smith."--She was afraid she had done her nothing
but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself,
in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original
author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might
otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet
had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill
before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt
completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed. 
She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. 
Her influence would have been enough.  And now she was very conscious
that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been
risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds. 
Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she
must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five
hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--"But, with
common sense," she added, "I am afraid I have had little to do."

She was extremely angry with herself.  If she could not have been
angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--
As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings
from any present solicitude on her account.  Harriet would
be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane,
whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,
must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil
were over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--
Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted. 
This discovery laid many smaller matters open.  No doubt it had been
from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might
any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed. 
An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,
and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. 
She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself
from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged
that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond
her desert.  But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! 
There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else. 
Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be
more severe than the first.  Considering the very superior claims
of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect
on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--
She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon
as possible.  An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's
parting words.  "For the present, the whole affair was to be
completely a secret.  Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,
as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum."--
Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.  It was her
superior duty.

In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,
that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to
perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself. 
The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,
she was now to be anxiously announcing to another.  Her heart beat
quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed,
had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was approaching Randalls. 
Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--
But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.

"Well, Miss Woodhouse!" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--
"is not this the oddest news that ever was?"

"What news do you mean?" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look
or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.

"About Jane Fairfax.  Did you ever hear any thing so strange? 
Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has
told me himself.  I met him just now.  He told me it was to be
a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning
it to any body but you, but he said you knew it."

"What did Mr. Weston tell you?"--said Emma, still perplexed.

"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank
Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately
engaged to one another this long while.  How very odd!"

It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,
that Emma did not know how to understand it.  Her character appeared
absolutely changed.  She seemed to propose shewing no agitation,
or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.  Emma looked
at her, quite unable to speak.

"Had you any idea," cried Harriet, "of his being in love
with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)
who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--"

"Upon my word," said Emma, "I begin to doubt my having any such talent. 
Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached
to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--
encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had
the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank
Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.  You may be
very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly."

"Me!" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.  "Why should you
caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."

"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,"
replied Emma, smiling; "but you do not mean to deny that there
was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason
to understand that you did care about him?"

"Him!--never, never.  Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?"
turning away distressed.

"Harriet!" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--"What do you mean?--
Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--"

She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she
sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.

Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned
from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,
it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.

"I should not have thought it possible," she began, "that you
could have misunderstood me!  I know we agreed never to name him--
but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,
I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed
to mean any other person.  Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!  I do not
know who would ever look at him in the company of the other. 
I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill,
who is like nobody by his side.  And that you should have been
so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you
entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment,
I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,
to dare to think of him.  At first, if you had not told me
that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been
matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);--
I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought
it possible--But if you, who had been always acquainted with him--"

"Harriet!" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--"Let us
understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. 
Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?"

"To be sure I am.  I never could have an idea of any body else--
and so I thought you knew.  When we talked about him, it was as clear
as possible."

"Not quite," returned Emma, with forced calmness, "for all that
you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. 
I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. 
I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you,
in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."

"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"

"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I
said on the occasion.  I told you that I did not wonder at
your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,
it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself
very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning
even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward
to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory."

"Oh, dear," cried Harriet, "now I recollect what you mean; but I
was thinking of something very different at the time.  It was not
the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.  No! (with
some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--
of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton
would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in
the room.  That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence
and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel
how superior he was to every other being upon earth."

"Good God!" cried Emma, "this has been a most unfortunate--
most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?"

"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? 
At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been,
if the other had been the person; and now--it is possible--"

She paused a few moments.  Emma could not speak.

"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse," she resumed, "that you should feel
a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. 
You must think one five hundred million times more above me than
the other.  But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--
strange as it may appear--.  But you know they were your own words,
that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity
had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,
it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--
and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--
if Mr. Knightley should really--if he does not mind the disparity,
I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,
and try to put difficulties in the way.  But you are too good for that,
I am sure."

Harriet was standing at one of the windows.  Emma turned round
to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,

"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?"

"Yes," replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--"I must say
that I have."

Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,
in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.  A few minutes were sufficient
for making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers,
once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--
she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it
so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,
than with Frank Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased
by Harriet's having some hope of a return?  It darted through her,
with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one
but herself!

Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the
same few minutes.  She saw it all with a clearness which had
never blessed her before.  How improperly had she been acting
by Harriet!  How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,
how unfeeling had been her conduct!  What blindness, what madness,
had led her on!  It struck her with dreadful force, and she
was ready to give it every bad name in the world.  Some portion
of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--
some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice
by Harriet--(there would be no need of compassion to the girl
who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required
that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,)
gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness,
with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit
that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into;
and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest
which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve
to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--
Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,
she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed
the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,
the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--
Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.

Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad
to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,
and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,
to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling
delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,
were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less. 
Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation
that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,
such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--
She listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward
patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged,
or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;
but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and
tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--
especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory
brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.

Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since
those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,
found her much superior to his expectation.  From that evening,
or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her
to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking
to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having
indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness
and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it. 
When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked
by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be
acquainted with her.  Emma knew it to have been very much the case. 
She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--
Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--
and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had
known of his opinion of Harriet.  He praised her for being without
art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--
She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt
on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory,
many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,
a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,
a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,
by Emma.  Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,
and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed
undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences
to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not
without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,
was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk
at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,
and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from
the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more
particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular
way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed
to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--
But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,
he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--
The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour
before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his
being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said
that he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,
during their conversation, that though he must go to London,
it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,
which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to her. 
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one
article marked, gave her severe pain.

On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,
after a little reflection, venture the following question. 
"Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,
into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--
he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?  But Harriet rejected
the suspicion with spirit.

"Mr. Martin!  No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. 
I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be
suspected of it."

When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear
Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.

"I never should have presumed to think of it at first," said she,
"but for you.  You told me to observe him carefully, and let
his behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.  But now I seem
to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,
it will not be any thing so very wonderful."

The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter
feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side,
to enable her to say on reply,

"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is
the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman
the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does."

Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;
and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at
that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her
father's footsteps.  He was coming through the hall.  Harriet was
too much agitated to encounter him.  "She could not compose herself--
Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;"--with most ready
encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through
another door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous
burst of Emma's feelings:  "Oh God! that I had never seen her!"

The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough
for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion
of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours. 
Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize
must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all! 
How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising
on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her
own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her
own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,
she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed
on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing
on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,
and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.

To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the
first endeavour.  To that point went every leisure moment which her
father's claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary
absence of mind.

How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling
declared him now to be?  When had his influence, such influence begun?--
When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank
Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;
she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in
her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--
and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--
oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute
the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she
did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when
his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.  She saw,
that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary,
she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her
own heart--and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank
Churchill at all!

This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. 
This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,
which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--
She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation
but the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--
Every other part of her mind was disgusting.

With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every
body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every
body's destiny.  She was proved to have been universally mistaken;
and she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief. 
She had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared,
on Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to
take place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it
a beginning; for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only
by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case,
he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly.

Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every
wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane
Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison,
exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing
to be said or thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an
elevation on her side!  Such a debasement on his!  It was horrible
to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion,
to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at
his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand
inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible. 
And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new
circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by
very inferior powers?  Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek,
to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any
thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for
chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?

Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward!  Had she left her where
she ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not,
with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying
the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy
and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong--
all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.

How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise
her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy
herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!--
But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.--
Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.--
She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop
in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.--
Alas! was not that her own doing too?  Who had been at pains to give
Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but herself
had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,
and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--
If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.

CHAPTER XII

Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known
how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley,
first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so,
and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;
and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly
important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;
for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been
only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she
had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. 
She had herself been first with him for many years past. 
She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse,
slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of
half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not
acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,
from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind,
he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour
to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no
other creature had at all shared.  In spite of all her faults,
she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?--
When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,
presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them. 
Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,
exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.  She could not. 
She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment
to her.  She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.--
How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!  How directly,
how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too
strongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from
any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.--
She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could
have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question;
but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,)
that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his
regard for her.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the consequence
nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life. 
Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all,
she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue
the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley
to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their
precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace
would be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. 
It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with
what she felt for him.  Nothing should separate her from her father. 
She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.

It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed;
and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at
least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should
see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly
as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching,
she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.--
He was expected back every day.  The power of observation would be
soon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in
one course.  In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.--
It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good,
to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced,
as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing
Harriet's confidence.  To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote
to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not,
at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction,
that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better
be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before
they met again, except in the company of others--she objected only
to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten
the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved,
and was grateful.

This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's
thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,
sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had
been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her
way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself,
to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.

Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his
share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having
then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned
with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction,
than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all
the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.

A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while
her friend related.  Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit
in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had
wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write
to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till
a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled
to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing,
she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--
but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious
to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not
conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,
that it would be of any consequence; for "such things," he observed,
"always got about."  Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had
very good reason for saying so.  They had gone, in short--and very
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. 
She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action
had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.  The quiet,
heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight
of her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,
had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.  They were
both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested
in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,
and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work
for them.  Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea
for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and
declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the
course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,
overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse
on the important subject.  Apologies for her seemingly ungracious
silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the
gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,
must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,
they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state
of the engagement.  Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation
must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own
mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased
with all that she had said on the subject.

"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment
of so many months," continued Mrs. Weston, "she was energetic. 
This was one of her expressions.  `I will not say, that since I
entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I
can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--
and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation
that I felt at my heart."

"Poor girl!" said Emma.  "She thinks herself wrong, then, for having
consented to a private engagement?"

"Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed
to blame herself.  `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state
of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.  But after all the
punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. 
Pain is no expiation.  I never can be blameless.  I have been acting
contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every
thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my
conscience tells me ought not to be.'  `Do not imagine, madam,'
she continued, `that I was taught wrong.  Do not let any reflection
fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought
me up.  The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that,
with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,
I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'"

"Poor girl!" said Emma again.  "She loves him then excessively,
I suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could
be led to form the engagement.  Her affection must have overpowered
her judgment."

"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him."

"I am afraid," returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have
contributed to make her unhappy."

"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.  But she
probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding
to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. 
One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,"
she said, "was that of making her unreasonable.  The consciousness
of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,
and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--
that had been--hard for him to bear.  `I did not make the allowances,'
said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--
his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness
of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure,
have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' 
She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you
had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me
how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity,
to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and
every endeavour to do her good.  She was sensible that you had never
received any proper acknowledgment from herself."

"If I did not know her to be happy now," said Emma, seriously,
"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous
conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! 
Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil
and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,
and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten. 
You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars. 
They shew her to the greatest advantage.  I am sure she is very good--
I hope she will be very happy.  It is fit that the fortune
should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers."

Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. 
She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,
she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. 
She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--
but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone
to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;
and when Mrs. Weston ended with, "We have not yet had the letter
we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,"
she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged
to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it
was which they were so anxious for.

"Are you well, my Emma?" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.

"Oh! perfectly.  I am always well, you know.  Be sure to give me
intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."

Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for
unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,
and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.  She bitterly
regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed
for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,
the cause.  Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying
that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she
tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy;
had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith;
she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain
which pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,
had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received
with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that
they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been
admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--
which was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,
and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable
suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had
not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so
unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made
a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings,
by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's.  Of all the sources
of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury,
she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst. 
She must have been a perpetual enemy.  They never could have been
all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace
in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been
the agony of a mind that would bear no more.

The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. 
The weather added what it could of gloom.  A cold stormy rain set in,
and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the
wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made
such cruel sights the longer visible.

The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side,
and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. 
It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening
of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked
in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. 
Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those
sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.  The picture which
she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,
had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures
had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would
experience no similar contradiction.  The prospect before her now,
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--
that might not be even partially brightened.  If all took place
that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must
be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the
spirits only of ruined happiness.

The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer
than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied
by it.  They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure,
her husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more;
and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease
to belong to Highbury.  They would be married, and settled either
at or near Enscombe.  All that were good would be withdrawn; and if
to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would
remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? 
Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!--
No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change
his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured?  And if he were
to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought
of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted;
if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,
the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;
what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far
distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?

When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain
from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room
for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation
or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own
better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and
gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life
to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted
with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.

CHAPTER XIII

The weather continued much the same all the following morning;
and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to
reign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind
changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off;
the sun appeared; it was summer again.  With all the eagerness
which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors
as soon as possible.  Never had the exquisite sight, smell,
sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm,
been more attractive to her.  She longed for the serenity they might
gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner,
with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill
hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,
and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she
saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming
towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned
from London.  She had been thinking of him the moment before,
as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for
the quickest arrangement of mind.  She must be collected and calm. 
In half a minute they were together.  The "How d'ye do's" were quiet
and constrained on each side.  She asked after their mutual friends;
they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning. 
He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her,
she found.  "He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he
was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors."--She thought
he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible
cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been
communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner
in which they had been received.

They walked together.  He was silent.  She thought he was often
looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it
suited her to give.  And this belief produced another dread. 
Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;
he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,
could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject. 
He must do it all himself.  Yet she could not bear this silence. 
With him it was most unnatural.  She considered--resolved--and, trying
to smile, began--

"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather
surprize you."

"Have I?" said he quietly, and looking at her; "of what nature?"

"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding."

After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,
he replied,

"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard
that already."

"How is it possible?" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks
towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he
might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.

"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,
and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened."

Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little
more composure,

"You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have
had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give
me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking
voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness."

For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious
of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm
drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him
thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,

"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own
excellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know
you will not allow yourself--."  Her arm was pressed again,
as he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, "The feelings
of the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!"--
And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, "He will soon
be gone.  They will soon be in Yorkshire.  I am sorry for her. 
She deserves a better fate."

Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the
flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,

"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--
I am not in want of that sort of compassion.  My blindness to what
was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always
be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many
things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I
have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier."

"Emma!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"--
but checking himself--"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am
pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret,
indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes
the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your
affections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess,
from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--
I could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference
which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name
of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--
Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature."

"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--
"I am in a very extraordinary situation.  I cannot let you continue in
your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,
I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have
been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might
be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--
But I never have."

He listened in perfect silence.  She wished him to speak, but he
would not.  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled
to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower
herself in his opinion.  She went on, however.

"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted
by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--
An old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened
to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable
in one who sets up as I do for Understanding.  Many circumstances
assisted the temptation.  He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was
continually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,
for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,
they all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I
allowed his attentions.  Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--
I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them
a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side. 
He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me.  I have never been
attached to him.  And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. 
He never wished to attach me.  It was merely a blind to conceal
his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind
all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually
blinded than myself--except that I was not blinded--that it was my
good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."

She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her
conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far
as she could judge, deep in thought.  At last, and tolerably
in his usual tone, he said,

"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,
however, that I may have underrated him.  My acquaintance with
him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated
him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has
a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake,
whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,
I shall certainly wish him well."

"I have no doubt of their being happy together," said Emma;
"I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."

"He is a most fortunate man!" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. 
"So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man
chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill.  At three-and-twenty
to have drawn such a prize!  What years of felicity that man,
in all human calculation, has before him!--Assured of the love of
such a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character
vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,--
equality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the
habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--
and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,
such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the
only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman
a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,
where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest
of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. 
Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman
at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her
by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought round
the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found
her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has
only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--
He had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--
He is a fortunate man indeed!"

"You speak as if you envied him."

"And I do envy him, Emma.  In one respect he is the object of my envy."

Emma could say no more.  They seemed to be within half a sentence
of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,
if possible.  She made her plan; she would speak of something
totally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she
only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her,
by saying,

"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined,
I see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but I cannot be wise. 
Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it
unsaid the next moment."

"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagerly cried. 
"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."

"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not
another syllable followed.

Emma could not bear to give him pain.  He was wishing to confide in her--
perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen. 
She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;
she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him
his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,
which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind
as his.--They had reached the house.

"You are going in, I suppose?" said he.

"No,"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner
in which he still spoke--"I should like to take another turn. 
Mr. Perry is not gone."  And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--
"I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid,
gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me
as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have
in contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will
hear whatever you like.  I will tell you exactly what I think."

"As a friend!"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--"Emma, that I fear is
a word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--
I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--
Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you
as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?"

He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression
of his eyes overpowered her.

"My dearest Emma," said he, "for dearest you will always be,
whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest,
most beloved Emma--tell me at once.  Say `No,' if it is to be said."--
She could really say nothing.--"You are silent," he cried,
with great animation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more."

Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. 
The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps
the most prominent feeling.

"I cannot make speeches, Emma:"  he soon resumed; and in a tone
of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was
tolerably convincing.--"If I loved you less, I might be able
to talk about it more.  But you know what I am.--You hear nothing
but truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you
have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--
Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as
you have borne with them.  The manner, perhaps, may have as little
to recommend them.  God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--
But you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--
and will return them if you can.  At present, I ask only to hear,
once to hear your voice."

While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful
velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--
to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that
Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion,
as complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing;
that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying
relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her
own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,
her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement
from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions,
with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to
rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve
that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could
now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment
which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection
from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--
or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him
at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he
could not marry them both, Emma had it not.  She felt for Harriet,
with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,
opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. 
She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to
her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings,
and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such
alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading.  Her way was clear,
though not quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.--
What did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.  A lady always does.--
She said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him
to say more himself.  He had despaired at one period; he had received
such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed
every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had
perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn,
her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to,
might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency;
but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no
farther explanation.

Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;
seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised,
or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct
is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--
Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than
she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.

He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. 
He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. 
He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's
engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,
if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest
had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard,
on his feelings.  The delightful assurance of her total indifference
towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged
from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain
her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only,
in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be
told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior
hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--
The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,
if he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed
from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like
perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.

Her change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the
same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each
the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,
there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,
or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love
with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period,
one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other. 
It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from
the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away. 
He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,
encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.--
But he had gone to a wrong place.  There was too much domestic
happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it;
Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking
inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,
for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had
stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's
post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the
gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,
having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,
was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,
that he could stay no longer.  He had ridden home through the rain;
and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest
and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults,
bore the discovery.

He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--
He heard her declare that she had never loved him.  Frank Churchill's
character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,
when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought
of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort
of fellow.

CHAPTER XIV

What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house
from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope
for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite
flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed
must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.

They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--
how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen
on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful
effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,
never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could
summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,
or even the attentive daughter.

Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him
in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so
anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he
have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs;
but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,
without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in
the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably
all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked
on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they
could have told him in return.

As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;
but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised
and subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was
the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious
points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness
must have some alloy.  Her father--and Harriet.  She could not be
alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;
and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question. 
With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered. 
She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short
parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution
of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it,
as a sin of thought.  While he lived, it must be only an engagement;
but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of
drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--
How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--
how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make
her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--
On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--
and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter
reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--
She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a
meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter;
that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just
now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--
nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation
for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;
and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--
She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited
by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--
At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,
from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting
of the evil day, when they must all be together again.

She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment
which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,
in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon;
and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again
with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate
her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.

He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have
the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter
was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed
what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--
She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted
no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--
and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was
incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.  She opened
the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself,
ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.

"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding
to you the enclosed.  I know what thorough justice you will
do it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think
we shall never materially disagree about the writer again;
but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.--
This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have
been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday,
but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being
affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.--
I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday
afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing
last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.
                              "Yours ever,
                                                       "A. W."

                       [To Mrs. Weston.]
                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.
MY DEAR MADAM,

"If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;
but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.--
You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even
all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--
But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. 
My courage rises while I write.  It is very difficult for the
prosperous to be humble.  I have already met with such success
in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking
myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have
had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend
the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls;
you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept
at all hazards.  This was the fact.  My right to place myself
in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question. 
I shall not discuss it here.  For my temptation to think it a right,
I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,
and casements above, in Highbury.  I dared not address her openly;
my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well
known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,
before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female
mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--
Had she refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say,
what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--
To any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,
sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. 
Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings
secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence. 
If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam,
of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting
a disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses
or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these
circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I
am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid. 
You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax
was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you will
forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion,
by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house,
so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.  My behaviour,
during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not,
I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. 
And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my
conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,
or requires very solicitous explanation.  With the greatest respect,
and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father
perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.--
A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion,
and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour
to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--
In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led
on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy
into which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss
Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe
the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference,
I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.--
Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me
the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was
perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much
my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy,
friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me. 
We seemed to understand each other.  From our relative situation,
those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss
Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of
that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,
I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,
and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no
doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.--
She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must
have penetrated a part.  I cannot doubt it.  You will find,
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints,
that it did not take her wholly by surprize.  She frequently gave
me hints of it.  I remember her telling me at the ball, that I
owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--
I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted
by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss. 
While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,
I could deserve nothing from either.  Acquit me here, and procure
for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that
said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,
as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--
Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have
now a key to.  My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get
my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion. 
If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--
Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,
that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would
never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--
The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,
my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to. 
You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--
No description can describe her.  She must tell you herself what she is--
yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would
so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter,
which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.--
She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains,
I dare not depend.  I want to have your opinion of her looks. 
I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. 
Perhaps it is paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay;
I am impatient for a thousand particulars.  Remember how few
minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: 
and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness
or misery.  When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with,
of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad
with joy:  but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her,
and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. 
If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet. 
My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add
to this long letter.  You have not heard all that you ought to hear. 
I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,
and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out,
needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you
will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects,
I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the
very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. 
I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have
felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--
But I had no choice.  The hasty engagement she had entered into with
that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,
to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,
and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter
what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect
for me.  I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners
to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable. 
She disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of
concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;
I thought unreasonably so:  I thought her, on a thousand occasions,
unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:  I thought her even cold. 
But she was always right.  If I had followed her judgment, and subdued
my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have
escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--
Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--There every little
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.  I was late;
I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her,
but she would not suffer it.  She absolutely refused to allow me,
which I then thought most unreasonable.  Now, however, I see nothing
in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion. 
While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one
hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she
to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made
every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together
between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.--
I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection. 
I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by
such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her,
and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been
impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her
resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--
In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,
abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,
though I might have staid with you till the next morning,
merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.  Even then,
I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time;
but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went
away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall
always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. 
Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would
ever have thought well of me again.  Its effect upon her appears
in the immediate resolution it produced:  as soon as she found I
was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that
officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,
by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. 
I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been
so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly
protest against the share of it which that woman has known.--
"Jane," indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself
in calling her by that name, even to you.  Think, then, what I must
have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all
the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of
imaginary superiority.  Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--
She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,
and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--
She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery
to each:  she dissolved it.--This letter reached me on the very
morning of my poor aunt's death.  I answered it within an hour;
but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business
falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all
the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk;
and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines,
to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather
disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;
but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--
too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor;
and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters
all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post,
stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply
to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could
not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both
to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible,
she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested,
that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them
to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period
to her at--:  in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's,
near Bristol, stared me in the face.  I knew the name, the place,
I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing. 
It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character
which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,
as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive
of its anxious delicacy.  For the world would not she have seemed
to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually
detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--
What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. 
Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--
I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened
away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,
wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!
with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness
in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be
of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must
have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while
all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury,
and saw how ill I had made her.  Do not pity me till I saw her wan,
sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my
knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance
of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was
not disappointed either in the object of my journey.  A great deal
of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. 
But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever,
and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again.  Now, my
dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before. 
A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have
ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart
will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier
than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me
the child of good fortune.  I hope she is right.--In one respect,
my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe
myself,
                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,
                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.

CHAPTER XV

This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings.  She was obliged,
in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do
it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.  As soon as she
came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating
to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable;
and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself,
by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the
very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at
that moment.  She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;
and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,
yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,
and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,
and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,
that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room,
she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.

She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,
she desired him to read it.  She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing
it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,
had seen so much to blame in his conduct.

"I shall be very glad to look it over," said he; "but it seems long. 
I will take it home with me at night."

But that would not do.  Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,
and she must return it by him.

"I would rather be talking to you," he replied; "but as it seems
a matter of justice, it shall be done."

He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I been offered
the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few
months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference."

He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,
with a smile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening: 
But it is his way.  One man's style must not be the rule of another's.
We will not be severe."

"It will be natural for me," he added shortly afterwards, "to speak my
opinion aloud as I read.  By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you. 
It will not be so great a loss of time:  but if you dislike it--"

"Not at all.  I should wish it."

Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.

"He trifles here," said he, "as to the temptation.  He knows
he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought
not to have formed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'--
he is unjust, however, to his father.  Mr. Weston's sanguine
temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;
but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured
to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here."

"And I have not forgotten," said Emma, "how sure you were that he
might have come sooner if he would.  You pass it over very handsomely--
but you were perfectly right."

"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--
had you not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him."

When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole
of it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look;
a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation;
or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however,
seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--

"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most
dangerous game.  Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--
No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his
own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--
Fancying you to have fathomed his secret.  Natural enough!--
his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it
in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding! 
My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the
beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?"

Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,
which she could not give any sincere explanation of.

"You had better go on," said she.

He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte! 
Ah!  That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young
to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much
exceed the pleasure.  A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot
comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection
which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did
know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she could."

After this, he made some progress without any pause. 
Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully
was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.

"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"--was then his remark. 
"You did behave very shamefully.  You never wrote a truer line." 
And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis
of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct
opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause
to say, "This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself,
for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness,
and it should have been his first object to prevent her from
suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,
in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.  He should have
respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers
were all reasonable.  We must look to her one fault, and remember
that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,
to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment."

Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party,
and grew uncomfortable.  Her own behaviour had been so very improper! 
She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. 
It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without
the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,
instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance
of Box Hill seemed to exist.

"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,
the Eltons," was his next observation.--"His feelings are natural.--
What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt
the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--
she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of
his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--"

"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers."

"I hope he does," replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter. 
"`Smallridge!'--What does this mean?  What is all this?"

"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--
a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and,
by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?"

"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even
of Mrs. Elton.  Only one page more.  I shall soon have done. 
What a letter the man writes!"

"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him."

"Well, there is feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding
her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her. 
`Dearer, much dearer than ever.'  I hope he may long continue to feel
all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker,
with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.' 
Come, he knows himself there.  `Miss Woodhouse calls me the child
of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--
And a fine ending--and there is the letter.  The child of good fortune! 
That was your name for him, was it?"

"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am;
but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better
of him for it.  I hope it does him some service with you."

"Yes, certainly it does.  He has had great faults, faults of
inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his
opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: 
but still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax,
and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly
with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve,
and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle
that it wants.  And now, let me talk to you of something else. 
I have another person's interest at present so much at heart,
that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.  Ever since I
left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on
one subject."

The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,
such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,
how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the
happiness of her father.  Emma's answer was ready at the first word. 
"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible
for her.  She could never quit him."  Part only of this answer,
however, was admitted.  The impossibility of her quitting her father,
Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility
of any other change, he could not agree to.  He had been thinking
it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce
Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe
it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer
him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,
that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort,
perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.  Mr. Woodhouse
taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted. 
But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted
his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;
it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as
her father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield
to continue her home, it should be his likewise.

Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own
passing thoughts.  Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;
but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her. 
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.  She felt that,
in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence
of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,
and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,
to be borne with.  She promised to think of it, and advised him
to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection
could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.  He had
given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;
he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,
to have his thoughts to himself.

"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for," cried Emma.  "I am
sure William Larkins will not like it.  You must get his consent
before you ask mine."

She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,
to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.

It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view
in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never
struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights
as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. 
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;
and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,
and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent
dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,
which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of
the sister and the aunt.

This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--
the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. 
His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,
their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.  Such a companion
for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--
Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be
giving increase of melancholy!

She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every
blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings
of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. 
The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,
poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a
distance from.  She would be a loser in every way.  Emma could not
deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment. 
In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;
but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity
that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.

In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,
supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. 
Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--
not like Mr. Elton.  Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,
so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be
less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even
of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men
in one year.

CHAPTER XVI

It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous
as herself to avoid a meeting.  Their intercourse was painful
enough by letter.  How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!

Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,
without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied
there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in
her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--
It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an
angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.

She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;
and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,
without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss. 
Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. 
Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill
health was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a
dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet
under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,
Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--
Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was
to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,
it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.

Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she
could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by
that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,
which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was
near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,
be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.

The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps
an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not
think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,
which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.

She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place
in her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication
before her, one which she only could be competent to make--
the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would
have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer
the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.  No additional
agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--
and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the
appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,
to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.

She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half
an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--
She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of
their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. 
It would be a secret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a
similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with
which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.

She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had
not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor
Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,
though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--
The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured
of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--
She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor
Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard
nothing but the instant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"--and a moment
afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly
forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--
Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging. 
There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every
thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--
She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very
feeling tone,

"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible
for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being
so entirely without words."

Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,
if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not
checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly
and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest
shake of the hand.

Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.  Miss Bates was out,
which accounted for the previous tranquillity.  Emma could have
wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience
with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,
she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.

She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,
and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;
it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself
acquainted with what was still a secret to other people. 
Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;
and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing
to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort
of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently
been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple
and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,

"We can finish this some other time, you know.  You and I shall
not want opportunities.  And, in fact, you have heard all the
essential already.  I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits
our apology, and is not offended.  You see how delightfully
she writes.  Oh! she is a sweet creature!  You would have doated
on her, had you gone.--But not a word more.  Let us be discreet--
quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--
I forget the poem at this moment:

        "For when a lady's in the case,
        "You know all other things give place."

Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read----mum! a word
to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?  But I want
to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--My representation, you see,
has quite appeased her."

And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look
at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,

"I mentioned no names, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as
a minister of state.  I managed it extremely well."

Emma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every
possible occasion.  When they had all talked a little while in harmony
of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,

"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the
highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)
Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--
Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!"--
And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,
"We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have;
not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;
Perry shall have all the credit."

"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,"
she shortly afterwards began, "since the party to Box Hill. 
Very pleasant party.  But yet I think there was something wanting. 
Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon
the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might
be mistaken.  However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one
to go again.  What say you both to our collecting the same party,
and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--
It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,
not one exception."

Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted
by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,
from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.

"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible
to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--
that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--
How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--
Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--
Charming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--
such attention to Jane!"--And from her great, her more than commonly
thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed
that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,
from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--
After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,
Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,

"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,
that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;
but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. 
He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you."

"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--
That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like
morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged."

"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning
to night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence
or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,
are always wanting his opinion.  They seem not able to do any thing
without him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.--
I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,
if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I
absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe
I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming,
I assure you:  yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all."  And putting
up her hand to screen her words from Emma--"A congratulatory visit,
you know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable."

Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!--

"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself
from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together
in deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand."

Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, "Is Mr. Elton
gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk."

"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. 
Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only
of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing
their own way."

"Have not you mistaken the day?" said Emma.  "I am almost certain
that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley
was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday."

"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day," was the abrupt answer,
which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--
"I do believe," she continued, "this is the most troublesome parish
that ever was.  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove."

"Your parish there was small," said Jane.

"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject
talked of."

"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard
you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;
the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children."

"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true.  What a thinking brain
you have!  I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,
if we could be shaken together.  My liveliness and your solidity
would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,
that some people may not think you perfection already.--But hush!--
not a word, if you please."

It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,
not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw. 
The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,
was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.

Mr. Elton made his appearance.  His lady greeted him with some
of her sparkling vivacity.

"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an
encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--
But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. 
You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--
Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies
a sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,
how soon it may be wanted?"

Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. 
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,
and the walk he had had for nothing.

"When I got to Donwell," said he, "Knightley could not be found. 
Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,
and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home
till one."

"Donwell!" cried his wife.--"My dear Mr. E., you have not been
to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown."

"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley
to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--
I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)
which made it so much the worse.  And then not to find him at home! 
I assure you I am not at all pleased.  And no apology left, no message
for me.  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--
Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. 
Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--
Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you
explain it?"

Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,
indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.

"I cannot imagine," said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife
ought to do,) "I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,
of all people in the world!  The very last person whom one should expect
to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,
I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--
and his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case: 
and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,
I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I
would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard
for any consideration.  And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds
her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never
sent it."

"I met William Larkins," continued Mr. Elton, "as I got near
the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,
but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour. 
He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he
could hardly ever get the speech of him.  I have nothing to do with
William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I
should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,
of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk
to no purpose."

Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. 
In all probability she was at this very time waited for there;
and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression
towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.

She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined
to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;
it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,
to say,

"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. 
Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been
tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more
openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should
certainly have been impertinent."

"Oh!" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her
usual composure--"there would have been no danger.  The danger
would have been of my wearying you.  You could not have gratified
me more than by expressing an interest--.  Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,
(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I
have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly
consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good
opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a
degree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say. 
I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. 
I feel it so very due.  But, unfortunately--in short, if your
compassion does not stand my friend--"

"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried Emma warmly,
and taking her hand.  "You owe me no apologies; and every body to
whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,
so delighted even--"

"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--
So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life
of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you."

"Pray say no more.  I feel that all the apologies should be on my side. 
Let us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be
done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. 
I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?"

"Very."

"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--
just as I begin to know you."

"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. 
I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."

"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps," replied Emma,
smiling--"but, excuse me, it must be thought of."

The smile was returned as Jane answered,

"You are very right; it has been thought of.  And I will own
to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living
with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.  There must be
three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,
I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for."

"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.--
Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!--
Good-bye, good-bye."

CHAPTER XVII

Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety;
and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased
to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. 
She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston.  She would
not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match
for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she was
convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best. 
It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--
and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have
his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks
and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--
no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it
would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,
should not have their powers in exercise again.

"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,"
she continued--"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis,
in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see
her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."

"That is," replied Mr. Knightley, "she will indulge her even more
than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. 
It will be the only difference."

"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of her?"

"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.  She will be disagreeable
in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.  I am losing
all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. 
I, who am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be horrible
ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"

Emma laughed, and replied:  "But I had the assistance of all
your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. 
I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it."

"Do you?--I have no doubt.  Nature gave you understanding:--
Miss Taylor gave you principles.  You must have done well. 
My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.  It was
very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--
and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done
in a disagreeable manner.  I do not believe I did you any good. 
The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest
affection to me.  I could not think about you so much without doating
on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least."

"I am sure you were of use to me," cried Emma.  "I was very often
influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. 
I am very sure you did me good.  And if poor little Anna Weston is
to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much
for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her
when she is thirteen."

"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one
of your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;
papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which,
you knew, I did not approve.  In such cases my interference was giving
you two bad feelings instead of one."

"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold
my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."

"`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and,
from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. 
I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what."

"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,
about ten years ago.  I did it because I thought it would offend you;
but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."

"And cannot you call me `George' now?"

"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.' 
I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,
by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise," she added presently,
laughing and blushing--"I will promise to call you once by your
Christian name.  I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess
where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse."

Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one
important service which his better sense would have rendered her,
to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all
her womanly follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith;
but it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.--
Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them.  This, on his side,
might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma
was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,
from some appearances, that their friendship were declining. 
She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances,
they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her
intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,
on Isabella's letters.  He might observe that it was so.  The pain
of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little
inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.

Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could
be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,
which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to
be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not
appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--
Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet
had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have
escaped her.  Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on,
by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be
a month at least.  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down
in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.

"John does not even mention your friend," said Mr. Knightley. 
"Here is his answer, if you like to see it."

It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. 
Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive
to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing
that her friend was unmentioned.

"John enters like a brother into my happiness," continued Mr. Knightley,
"but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,
likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from
making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather
cool in her praise.  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes."

"He writes like a sensible man," replied Emma, when she had read
the letter.  "I honour his sincerity.  It is very plain that he
considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,
but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy
of your affection, as you think me already.  Had he said any thing
to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him."

"My Emma, he means no such thing.  He only means--"

"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,"
interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--"much less, perhaps,
than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve
on the subject."

"Emma, my dear Emma--"

"Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy your
brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in
the secret, and hear his opinion.  Depend upon it, he will be much
farther from doing you justice.  He will think all the happiness,
all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit
on mine.  I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.--
His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."

"Ah!" he cried, "I wish your father might be half as easily convinced
as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,
to be happy together.  I am amused by one part of John's letter--
did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take
him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing
something of the kind."

"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having
some thoughts of marrying.  He had no idea of me.  He seems perfectly
unprepared for that."

"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into
my feelings.  What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious
of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare
him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--
But it was so, I suppose.  I dare say there was a difference when I
was staying with them the other day.  I believe I did not play
with the children quite so much as usual.  I remember one evening
the poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'"

The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons'
reception of it tried.  As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently
recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view
that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,
resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--
But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself
to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it
came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must
have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,
and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced
to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.  She must not make it a more
decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. 
She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits
she could command, she prepared him first for something strange,
and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation
could be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with
no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--
she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield
would receive the constant addition of that person's company
whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,
best in the world.

Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried
earnestly to dissuade her from it.  She was reminded, more than once,
of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it
would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of
poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.  Emma hung
about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that
he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages
taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: 
but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;
she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but
for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal
the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once
got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--
He would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want
to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,
who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--
Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he
like to have him always on the spot?--Yes.  That was all very true. 
Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see
him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could
not they go on as they had done?

Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,
the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--
To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,
whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;
and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--
They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters
of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,
on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most
serviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--
well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations
to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;
and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that
it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself
which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--
in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad
if the marriage did take place.

Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she
said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,
never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;
but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had
no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard
for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;
and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable
a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,
so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed
as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,
and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having
thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men
in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own
home for Hartfield!  And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear
with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--
The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always
felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank
and Emma.  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had
been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than
by herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject
better than by saying--"Those matters will take care of themselves;
the young people will find a way."  But here there was nothing to be
shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.  It was all right,
all open, all equal.  No sacrifice on any side worth the name. 
It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,
and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.

Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections
as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.  If any thing
could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would
soon have outgrown its first set of caps.

The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;
and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes
were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--
He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all
the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;
and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he
had always foreseen it.

"It is to be a secret, I conclude," said he.  "These matters are
always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. 
Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has
any suspicion."

He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on
that point.  He told her the news.  Was not she like a daughter,
his eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,
it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,
immediately afterwards.  It was no more than the principals were
prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known
at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking
of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,
with great sagacity.

In general, it was a very well approved match.  Some might think him,
and others might think her, the most in luck.  One set might
recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield
for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements
among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious
objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,
the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton
cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped "the
young lady's pride would now be contented;" and supposed "she had
always meant to catch Knightley if she could;" and, on the point
of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, "Rather he than I!"--
But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--"Poor Knightley!
poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;
for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--
How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--
not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all
pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine
with them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--
Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her. 
Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on
every thing.--Extremely disagreeable!  But she was not at all sorry
that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,
living together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple
Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end
of the first quarter.

CHAPTER XVIII

Time passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London
would be arriving.  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking
of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and
grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts
were put by.  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;
and then, in a graver tone, began with,

"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."

"Good or bad?" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.

"I do not know which it ought to be called."

"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.  You are trying
not to smile."

"I am afraid," said he, composing his features, "I am very much afraid,
my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it."

"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which
pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."

"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which
we do not think alike."  He paused a moment, again smiling,
with his eyes fixed on her face.  "Does nothing occur to you?--
Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith."

Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,
though she knew not what.

"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?" cried he. 
"You have, I believe, and know the whole."

"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."

"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. 
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."

Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--
and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!"
but her lips were closed.

"It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from Robert
Martin himself.  He left me not half an hour ago."

She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.

"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were
the same.  But in time they will.  Time, you may be sure, will make
one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,
we need not talk much on the subject."

"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied, exerting herself. 
"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,
but I cannot believe it.  It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean
to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.  You cannot
mean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.  You only mean,
that he intends it."

"I mean that he has done it," answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling
but determined decision, "and been accepted."

"Good God!" she cried.--"Well!"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,
in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the
exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she
must be expressing, she added, "Well, now tell me every thing;
make this intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all. 
I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,
I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?"

"It is a very simple story.  He went to town on business three days ago,
and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting
to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,
and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's.
They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party
was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. 
My friend Robert could not resist.  They called for him in their way;
were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with
them the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit
(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;
and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,
as happy even as he is deserving.  He came down by yesterday's coach,
and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report
his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own. 
This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. 
Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--
She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's
language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only
in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed
for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention,
without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their
box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley
and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;
and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith
rather uneasy."

He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,
she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree
of happiness.  She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. 
Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,
he added,

"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make
you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. 
His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies
your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better
of him as you know him more.  His good sense and good principles would
delight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your
friend in better hands.  His rank in society I would alter if I could,
which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me
about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."

He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself
not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,

"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.  I think
Harriet is doing extremely well.  Her connexions may be worse than his. 
In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. 
I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. 
You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly
unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more
determined against him, much more, than she was before."

"You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley;
"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,
not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told
her he loved her."

Emma could not help laughing as she answered, "Upon my word,
I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,
are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright
accepted him.  I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--
Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;
of business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,
in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not
Harriet's hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some
famous ox."

The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and
Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings,
and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently
passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words,
spoken with such emphasis, "No, I hope I know better than to think
of Robert Martin," that she was really expecting the intelligence
to prove, in some measure, premature.  It could not be otherwise.

"Do you dare say this?" cried Mr. Knightley.  "Do you dare to suppose
me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--
What do you deserve?"

"Oh!  I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put
up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,
direct answer.  Are you quite sure that you understand the terms
on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?"

"I am quite sure," he replied, speaking very distinctly, "that he
told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,
nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you
a proof that it must be so.  He asked my opinion as to what he
was now to do.  He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he
could apply for information of her relations or friends.  Could I
mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? 
I assured him that I could not.  Then, he said, he would endeavour
to see her in the course of this day."

"I am perfectly satisfied," replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,
"and most sincerely wish them happy."

"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before."

"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool."

"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all
Harriet's good qualities.  I have taken some pains for your sake,
and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe
as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. 
I have often talked to her a good deal.  You must have seen that
I did.  Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me
of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all
my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,
with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing
her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--
Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for."

"Me!" cried Emma, shaking her head.--"Ah! poor Harriet!"

She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little
more praise than she deserved.

Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of
her father.  She was not sorry.  She wanted to be alone.  Her mind
was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her
to be collected.  She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;
and till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed
and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.

Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put
the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;
and she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.

The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations
may be imagined.  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the
prospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming
too happy for security.--What had she to wish for?  Nothing, but to
grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been
ever so superior to her own.  Nothing, but that the lessons
of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.

Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;
and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst
of them.  She must laugh at such a close!  Such an end of the doleful
disappointment of five weeks back!  Such a heart--such a Harriet!

Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would
be a pleasure.  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.

High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,
was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from
Mr. Knightley would soon be over.  The disguise, equivocation,
mystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over. 
She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect
confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.

In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;
not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;
and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable
persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,
or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.

They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--
but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse
received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse
was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.

"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax," said Mrs. Weston.  "I was just
going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive
this morning.  He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been
persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope."

In half a minute they were in the room.  Emma was extremely glad
to see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of
embarrassing recollections on each side.  They met readily and smiling,
but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;
and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank
in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,
which she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,
and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. 
When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby
was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--
or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her
and say,

"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving
message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters.  I hope time has not made
you less willing to pardon.  I hope you do not retract what you
then said."

"No, indeed," cried Emma, most happy to begin, "not in the least. 
I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give
you joy in person."

He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak
with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.

"Is not she looking well?" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane. 
"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and
Mrs. Weston doat upon her."

But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,
after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named
the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced
in her hearing.

"I can never think of it," she cried, "without extreme shame."

"The shame," he answered, "is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it
possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.  Early, I know,
you had none."

"I never had the smallest, I assure you."

"That appears quite wonderful.  I was once very near--and I wish I had--
it would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong things,
they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--
It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond
of secrecy and told you every thing."

"It is not now worth a regret," said Emma.

"I have some hope," resumed he, "of my uncle's being persuaded
to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. 
When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,
and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,
I am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--
Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation. 
Do not you pity me?"

Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession
of gay thought, he cried,

"Ah! by the bye," then sinking his voice, and looking demure for
the moment--"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?"  He paused.--She coloured
and laughed.--"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember
my wish in your favour.  Let me return your congratulations.--
I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest
and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise."

Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;
but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his
own Jane, and his next words were,

"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--
and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. 
It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--
a most distinguishing complexion!  So peculiarly the lady in it.--
Just colour enough for beauty."

"I have always admired her complexion," replied Emma, archly; "but do not
I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--
When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?"

"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--"

But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could
not help saying,

"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,
you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--
I am sure it was a consolation to you."

"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? 
I was the most miserable wretch!"

"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.  I am sure it
was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking
us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell
you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself
in the same situation.  I think there is a little likeness between us."

He bowed.

"If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look of
true sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny
which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior
to our own."

"True, true," he answered, warmly.  "No, not true on your side.  You can
have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. 
Look at her.  Is not she an angel in every gesture?  Observe the turn
of her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--
You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)
that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels.  They are to be
new set.  I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. 
Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair?"

"Very beautiful, indeed," replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,
that he gratefully burst out,

"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such
excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. 
I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come."

The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an
account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,
from the infant's appearing not quite well.  She believed she had
been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half
a minute of sending for Mr. Perry.  Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,
but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,
however, the child had been perfectly well again.  This was
her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,
who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,
and only regretted that she had not done it.  "She should always send
for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,
were it only for a moment.  She could not be too soon alarmed,
nor send for Perry too often.  It was a pity, perhaps, that he
had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,
very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry
had seen it."

Frank Churchill caught the name.

"Perry!" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss
Fairfax's eye.  "My friend Mr. Perry!  What are they saying
about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does
he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?"

Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined
in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she
too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.

"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!" he cried.  "I can never think
of it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. 
I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. 
Look at her.  Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage
of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--
that the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to
nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?"

Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile
partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,
low, yet steady voice,

"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--
They will sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!"

He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;
but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on
leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men,
she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,
and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never
been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. 
The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the
animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.

CHAPTER XIX

If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,
a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured
of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept
another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she
had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty. 
A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no
sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,
than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--
that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,
and was now forming all her views of happiness.

Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first: 
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,
and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die
away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,
and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to
her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of
that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--
Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at
Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all
with the utmost delight.  But what did such particulars explain?--
The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had
always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had
been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible
to Emma.

The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her
fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. 
She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford
her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent
enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood
of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--
It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many
a gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for
Mr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--
The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,
would have been a stain indeed.

No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was
treated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became
acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,
she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth
which could bid fairest for her little friend.  She had no doubt
of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,
and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,
of security, stability, and improvement.  She would be placed in the
midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;
retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness. 
She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out. 
She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be
the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and
persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,
to yield only to herself.

Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,
was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--
The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must
change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought
to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,
natural manner.

Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw
her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,
as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood
before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she
scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the
altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,
the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.

Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the
comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills
were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.

The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,
by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage
ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,
to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,
which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,
were agreed in approving it.  But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse
to be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their
marriage but as a distant event.

When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they
were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--
He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--
a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. 
Still, however, he was not happy.  Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,
that his daughter's courage failed.  She could not bear to see
him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though
her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the
Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress
would be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.

In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden
illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his
nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--
Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--
evidently by the ingenuity of man.  Other poultry-yards in the
neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was housebreaking to
Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense
of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm
every night of his life.  The strength, resolution, and presence
of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. 
While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--
But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the
first week in November.

The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at
the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was
called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.

The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties
have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the
particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,
and very inferior to her own.--"Very little white satin, very few
lace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she
heard of it."--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,
the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band
of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered
in the perfect happiness of the union.

<CHAPTER I (1)>

IT is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be
on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is
considered as the rightful property of some one or other of
their daughters.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you
heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here,
and she told me all about it."

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife
impatiently.

"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield
is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of
England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to
see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed
with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession
before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
house by the end of next week."

"What is his name?"

"Bingley."

"Is he married or single?"

"Oh!  single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large
fortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for
our girls!"

"How so?  how can it affect them?"

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so
tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying
one of them."

"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Design!  nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely
that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you
must visit him as soon as he comes."

"I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or
you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still
better; for, as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley
might like you the best of the party."

"My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly _have_ had my share of
beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give
over thinking of her own beauty."

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he
comes into the neighbourhood."

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."

"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an establishment
it would be for one of them.  Sir William and Lady Lucas are
determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you
know they visit no new comers.  Indeed you must go, for it will
be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

"You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will
be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to
assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he
chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my
little Lizzy."

"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better
than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as
Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.  But you are always
giving _her_ the preference."

"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he;
"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy
has something more of quickness than her sisters."

"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such way?
You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion on my
poor nerves."

"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your
nerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention
them with consideration these twenty years at least."

"Ah!  you do not know what I suffer."

"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young
men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

"It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you
will not visit them."

"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will
visit them all."

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic
humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three
and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife
understand his character.  _Her_ mind was less difficult to
develope.  She was a woman of mean understanding, little
information, and uncertain temper.  When she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous.  The business of her life was to
get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

                              __

<CHAPTER II (2)>

MR. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on
Mr. Bingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though
to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go;
and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no
knowledge of it.  It was then disclosed in the following
manner.  Observing his second daughter employed in trimming
a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,

"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."

"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said
her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."

"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him
at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce
him."

"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has
two nieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman,
and I have no opinion of her."

"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that
you do not depend on her serving you."

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to
contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake!  Have a
little compassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces."

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father;
"she times them ill."

"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.

"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight."

"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come
back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to
introduce him, for she will not know him herself."

"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and
introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_."

"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted
with him myself; how can you be so teazing?"

"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight's acquaintance is
certainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by
the end of a fortnight.  But if we do not venture, somebody
else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand
their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of
kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."

The girls stared at their father.  Mrs. Bennet said only,
"Nonsense, nonsense!"

"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried
he.  "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress
that is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with
you _there_.  What say you, Mary?  for you are a young lady of
deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make
extracts."

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us
return to Mr. Bingley."

"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.

"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so
before?  If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would
not have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have
actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance
now."

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of
Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first
tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what
she had expected all the while.

"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I
should persuade you at last.  I was sure you loved our girls
too well to neglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased
I am!  and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have
gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now."

"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said
Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with
the raptures of his wife.

"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the
door was shut.  "I do not know how you will ever make him
amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.  At our
time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be
making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would
do any thing.  Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest,
I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."

"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_
the youngest, I'm the tallest."

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he
would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they
should ask him to dinner.

                              __

<CHAPTER III (3)>

NOT all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her
five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw
from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.
They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,
ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the
skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the
second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.  Her
report was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted
with him.  He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next
assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more delightful!
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in
love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were
entertained.

"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at
Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the
others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat
about ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained
hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of
whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the
advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a
blue coat and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and
already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do
credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which
deferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the
following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of
their invitation, &c.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.  She
could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon
after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and
never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.  Lady Lucas
quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being
gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a
report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve
ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls
grieved over such a large number of ladies; but were comforted
the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he
had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and
a cousin.  And when the party entered the assembly room, it
consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two
sisters, the husband of the oldest, and another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a
pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His
brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his
friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his
fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the
report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.  The
gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the
ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he
was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening,
till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his
popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his
company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate
in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be
compared with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the
principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,
danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,
and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable
qualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between
him and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to
any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking
about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided.  He was the proudest, most
disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he
would never come there again.  Amongst the most violent against
him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was
sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one
of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of
gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of
that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her
to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who
came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend
to join it.

"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.  I hate to see
you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had
much better dance."

"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly
as this, it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged,
and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be
a punishment to me to stand up with."

"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for
a kingdom!  Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant
girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several
of them, you see, uncommonly pretty."

"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"
said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

"Oh!  she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But
there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who
is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.  Do let me ask
my partner to introduce you."

"Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a
moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his
own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome
enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give
consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles,
for you are wasting your time with me."

Mr. Bingley followed his advice.  Mr. Darcy walked off; and
Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends;
for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in
any thing ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole
family.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired
by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with her
twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane was
as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a
quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.  Mary had heard
herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl
in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all
that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned
therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they
lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They
found Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book, he was regardless of
time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of
curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such
splendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found
that he had a very different story to hear.

"Oh!  my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have
had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish
you had been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like
it.  Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley
thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.  Only
think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and
she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.  First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to
see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her
at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite
struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.  So, he
enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the
two next.  Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and
the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger -- "

"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband
impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much!  For God's
sake, say no more of his partners.  Oh!  that he had sprained
his ancle in the first dance!"

"Oh!  my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I am quite delighted
with him.  He is so excessively handsome!  and his sisters are
charming women.  I never in my life saw any thing more elegant
than their dresses.  I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's
gown -- "

Here she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against
any description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek
another branch of the subject, and related, with much
bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking
rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose
much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,
horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so
conceited that there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and
he walked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome
enough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to
have given him one of your set downs.  I quite detest the man."

                              __

<CHAPTER IV (4)>

WHEN Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been
cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her
sister how very much she admired him.

"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible,
good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! --
so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man
ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is
thereby complete."

"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second
time.  I did not expect such a compliment."

"Did not you?  _I_ did for you.  But that is one great
difference between us.  Compliments always take _you_ by
surprise, and _me_ never.  What could be more natural than his
asking you again?  He could not help seeing that you were about
five times as pretty as every other women in the room.  No
thanks to his gallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very
agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.  You have liked
many a stupider person."

"Dear Lizzy!"

"Oh!  you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in
general.  You never see a fault in any body.  All the world are
good and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill
of a human being in my life."

"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I
always speak what I think."

"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.
With _your_ good sense, to be honestly blind to the follies
and nonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common
enough; -- one meets it every where.  But to be candid without
ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body's
character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad
-- belongs to you alone.  And so, you like this man's sisters
too, do you?  Their manners are not equal to his."

"Certainly not; at first.  But they are very pleasing women
when you converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her
brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall
not find a very charming neighbour in her."

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced.  Their
behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in
general; and with more quickness of observation and less
pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment, too,
unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little
disposed to approve them.  They were in fact very fine ladies,
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and
conceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in one
of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of
twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than
they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were
therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.  They were of a respectable
family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune
and their own had been acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an
hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to
purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. -- Mr. Bingley
intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of
a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the
easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next
generation to purchase.

His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his
own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss
Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor
was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than
fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when
it suited her.  Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when
he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at
Netherfield House.  He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms,
satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in
spite of a great opposition of character. -- Bingley was
endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his
temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to
his own, and though with his own he never appeared
dissatisfied.  On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had
the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior.  Bingley was by no
means deficient, but Darcy was clever.  He was at the same time
haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well
bred, were not inviting.  In that respect his friend had
greatly the advantage.  Bingley was sure of being liked
wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was
sufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with
pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had
been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no
formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all
the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.  Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection
of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none
received either attention or pleasure.  Miss Bennet he
acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they
admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet
girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and
their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of
her as he chose.

                              __

<CHAPTER V (5)>

WITHIN a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the
Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had been
formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable
fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to
the King during his mayoralty.  The distinction had perhaps
been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to his
business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas
Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own
importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely
in being civil to all the world.  For though elated by his
rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he
was all attention to every body.  By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made
him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be
a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. -- They had several
children.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young
woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk
over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the
assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to
communicate.

"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet
with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.  "You were Mr.
Bingley's first choice."

"Yes; -- but he seemed to like his second better."

"Oh! -- you mean Jane, I suppose -- because he danced with her
twice.  To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her --
indeed I rather believe he _did_ -- I heard something about it
-- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson."

"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.
Robinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson's asking
him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did
not think there were a great many pretty women in the room,
and _which_ he thought the prettiest?  and his answering
immediately to the last question -- ``Oh!  the eldest Miss
Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that
point.''"

"Upon my word! -- Well, that was very decided indeed --
that does seem as if -- but, however, it may all come to
nothing, you know."

"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_,
Eliza," said Charlotte.  "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth
listening to as his friend, is he? -- Poor Eliza! -- to be
only just _tolerable_."

"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by
his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it
would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long
told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour
without once opening his lips."

"Are you quite sure, Ma'am? -- is not there a little mistake?"
said Jane. -- "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."

"Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,
and he could not help answering her; -- but she said he seemed
very angry at being spoke to."

"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much
unless among his intimate acquaintance.  With _them_ he is
remarkably agreeable."

"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so
very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can
guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride,
and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not
keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."

"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas,
"but I wish he had danced with Eliza."

"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with
_him_, if I were you."

"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance
with him."

"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much
as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One
cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family,
fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of
himself.  If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be
proud."

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily
forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of
her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.  By all
that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common
indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that
there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of
self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or
imaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the
words are often used synonimously.  A person may be proud
without being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."

"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came
with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.  I would
keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every
day."

"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said
Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take
away your bottle directly."

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare
that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.

                              __

<CHAPTER VI (6)>

THE ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.
The visit was returned in due form.  Miss Bennet's pleasing
manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley;
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the
younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better
acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest.
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure;
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not
like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a
value, as arising in all probability from the influence of
their brother's admiration.  It was generally evident whenever
they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally
evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had
begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to
be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since
Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of
temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard
her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She mentioned this
to her friend Miss Lucas.

"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to
impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a
disadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her
affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may
lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but
poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can
all _begin_ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough;
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really
in love without encouragement.  In nine cases out of ten, a
woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.  Bingley
likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than
like her, if she does not help him on."

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton
indeed not to discover it too."

"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as
you do."

"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to
conceal it, he must find it out."

"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But though Bingley
and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours
together; and as they always see each other in large mixed
parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed
in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make the most of
every half hour in which she can command his attention.  When
she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love
as much as she chuses."

"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is
in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were
determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I
should adopt it.  But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not
acting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the
degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.  She has
known him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him at
Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has
since dined in company with him four times.  This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."

"Not as you represent it.  Had she merely _dined_ with him, she
might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but
you must remember that four evenings have been also spent
together -- and four evenings may do a great deal."

"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that
they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect
to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much
has been unfolded."

"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart;
and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she
had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying
his character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is
entirely a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the
parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so
similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.  They always contrive to grow sufficiently unlike
afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to
know as little as possible of the defects of the person with
whom you are to pass your life."

"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know
it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way
yourself."

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister,
Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming
an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.
Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he
had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they
next met, he looked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner
had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was
endered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of
her dark eyes.  To this discovery succeeded some others equally
mortifying.  Though he had detected with a critical eye more
than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced
to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in
spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the
fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.  Of
this she was perfectly unaware; -- to her he was only the man
who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought
her handsome enough to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards
conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with
others.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William
Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.  "What does
Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"

"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."

"But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know
that I see what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and
if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon
grow afraid of him."

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming
to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend
to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking
Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,

"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself
uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to
give us a ball at Meryton?"

"With great energy; -- but it is a subject which always makes a
lady energetic."

"You are severe on us."

"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what
follows."

"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! -- always
wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body! --
If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been
invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down
before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best
performers."  On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added,
"Very well; if it must be so, it must."  And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body
here is of course familiar with -- ``Keep your breath to cool
your porridge,'' -- and I shall keep mine to swell my song."

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the
entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was
eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who
having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the
family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was
always impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given
her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and
conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of
excellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and
unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure,
though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long
concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch
and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases and two or three officers, joined
eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode
of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation,
and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that
Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus
began.

"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!
-- There is nothing like dancing after all. -- I consider it as
one of the first refinements of polished societies."

"Certainly, Sir; -- and it has the advantage also of being in
vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. --
Every savage can dance."

Sir William only smiled.  "Your friend performs delightfully;"
he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;
-- "and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science
yourself, Mr. Darcy."

"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the
sight.  Do you often dance at St. James's?"

"Never, sir."

"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the
place?"

"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place, if I can
avoid it."

"You have a house in town, I conclude?"

Mr. Darcy bowed.

"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for I am
fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that
the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not
disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving
towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very
gallant thing, and called out to her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? -- Mr. Darcy,
you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very
desirable partner. -- You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure,
when so much beauty is before you."  And taking her hand,
he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely
surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. -- I
entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to
beg for a partner."

Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the
honour of her hand; but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor
did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at
persuasion.

"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel
to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this
gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no
objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour."

"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.

"He is indeed -- but considering the inducement, my dear Miss
Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would
object to such a partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had
not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her
with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley.

"I can guess the subject of your reverie."

"I should imagine not."

"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner -- in such society; and indeed I am
quite of your opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The
insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the
self-importance of all these people! -- What would I give to
hear your strictures on them!"

"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was
more agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very
great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a
pretty woman can bestow."

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and
desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring
such reflections.  Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.  "I am all
astonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite? -- and
pray when am I to wish you joy?"

"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to
love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would be
wishing me joy."

"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the
matter as absolutely settled.  You will have a charming
mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at
Pemberley with you."

He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose
to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure
convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.

                              __

<CHAPTER VIII (8)>

AT five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half
past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil
enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the
pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of
Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.
Jane was by no means better.  The sisters, on hearing this,
repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they
disliked being ill themselves, and then thought no more of the
matter; and their indifference towards Jane, when not
immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of
all her original dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she
could regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was
evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they
prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she
believed she was considered by the others.  She had very little
notice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by
Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst,
by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only
to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer
a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss
Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of
pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no stile, no
taste, no beauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,

"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an
excellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this
morning.  She really looked almost wild."

"She did indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.
Very nonsensical to come at all!  Why must _she_ be scampering
about the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair so
untidy, so blowsy!"

"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six
inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which
had been let down to hide it not doing its office."

"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley;
"but this was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth
Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this
morning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."

"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley,
"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see
_your_ _sister_ make such an exhibition."

"Certainly not."

"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever
it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  what
could she mean by it?  It seems to me to shew an abominable
sort of conceited independence, a most country town
indifference to decorum."

"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,"
said Bingley.

"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half
whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your
admiration of her fine eyes."

"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the
exercise." -- A short pause followed this speech, and
Mrs. Hurst began again.

"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a
very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well
settled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low
connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."

"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney
in Meryton."

"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near
Cheapside."

"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed
heartily.

"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried
Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."

"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying
men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it
their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at
the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her
room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till
summoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth
would not quit her at all till late in the evening, when she
had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to
her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs
herself.  On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but
suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making
her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the
short time she could stay below with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked
at her with astonishment.

"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather
singular."

"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else."

"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried
Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in
many things."

"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said
Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her
quite well."

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a
table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered to
fetch her others; all that his library afforded.

"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and
my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not
many, I have more than I ever look into."

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly
with those in the room.

"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should
have left so small a collection of books. -- What a delightful
library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"

"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of
many generations."

"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always
buying books."

"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such
days as these,"

"Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the
beauties of that noble place.  Charles, when you build _your_
house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."

"I wish it may."

"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in
that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."

"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will
sell it."

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."

"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."

Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her
very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly
aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself
between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game.

"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley;
"will she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's
height, or rather taller."

"How I long to see her again!  I never met with anybody who
delighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners, and
so extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the
piano-forte is exquisite."

"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have
patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."

"All young ladies accomplished!  My dear Charles, what do you
mean?"

"Yes all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover
skreens, and net purses.  I scarcely know any one who cannot
do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken
of for the first time, without being informed that she was
very accomplished."

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said
Darcy, "has too much truth.  The word is applied to many a
woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse,
or covering a skreen.  But I am very far from agreeing with
you in your estimation of ladies in general.  I cannot boast
of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."

"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.

"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal
in your idea of an accomplished women."

"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."

"Oh!  certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be
really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what
is usually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of
music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to
deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a
certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of
her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but
half deserved."

"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she
must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of
her mind by extensive reading."

"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six
accomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing
_any_."

"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the
possibility of all this?"

"_I_ never saw such a woman, _I_ never saw such capacity, and
taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the
injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that
they knew many women who answered this description, when
Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their
inattention to what was going forward.  As all conversation was
thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.

"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on
her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend
themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own, and with
many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my opinion, it is a
paltry device, a very mean art."

"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly
addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies
sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever bears
affinity to cunning is despicable."

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as
to continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was
worse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr.
Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters,
convinced that no country advice could be of any service,
recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent
physicians.  This she would not hear of, but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was
settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning
if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.  Bingley was quite
uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after
supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings
than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

                              __

<CHAPTER IX (9)>

ELIZABETH passed the chief of the night in her sister's
room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to
send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early
received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time
afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.  In spite of this amendment, however, she requested
to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit
Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.  The note
was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly
complied with.  Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest
girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would
have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her,
that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her
recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would
probably remove her from Netherfield.  She would not listen
therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home;
neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time,
think it at all advisable.  After sitting a little while with
Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation the mother
and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast
parlour.  Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not
found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.  "She is a great deal too
ill to be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving
her.  We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."

"Removed!" cried Bingley.  "It must not be thought of.  My
sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."

"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold
civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible
attention while she remains with us."

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends
I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill
indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest
patience in the world -- which is always the way with her, for
she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met
with.  I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming
prospect over that gravel walk.  I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield.  You will not think of
quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short
lease."

"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore
if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be
off in five minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as
quite fixed here."

"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said
Elizabeth.

"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning
towards her.

"Oh!  yes -- I understand you perfectly.".

"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily
seen through I am afraid is pitiful."

"That is as it happens.  It does not necessarily follow that a
deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a
one as yours."

"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not
run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately,
"that you were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing
study."

"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.  They
have at least that advantage."

"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few
subjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you
move in a very confined and unvarying society."

"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something
new to be observed in them for ever."

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of
mentioning a country neighbourhood.  "I assure you there is
quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."

Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her
for a moment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied
she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her
triumph.

"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the
country for my part, except the shops and public places.  The
country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?"

"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to
leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy
in either."

"Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition.  But
that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the
country was nothing at all."

"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for
her mother.  "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that
there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the
country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."

"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not
meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there
are few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with four and
twenty families."

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley
to keep his countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and
directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive
smile.  Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might
turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas
had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable
man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley -- is not he?  so much the man
of fashion!  so genteel and so easy! -- He has always something
to say to every body. -- _That_ is my idea of good breeding;
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never
open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."

"Did Charlotte dine with you?"

"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about the mince
pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that
can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up
differently.  But every body is to judge for themselves, and
the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a
pity they are not handsome!  Not that _I_ think Charlotte so
_very_ plain -- but then she is our particular friend."

"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.

"Oh!  dear, yes; -- but you must own she is very plain.  Lady
Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane --
one does not often see any body better looking.  It is what
every body says.  I do not trust my own partiality.  When she
was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother
Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we
came away.  But however he did not.  Perhaps he thought her too
young.  However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty
they were."

"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving
away love!"

"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,"
said Darcy.

"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Every thing nourishes
what is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort
of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve
it entirely away."

Darcy only smiled, and the general pause which ensued made
Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself
again.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;
and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her
thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology
for troubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister
to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.  She
performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but
Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her
carriage.  Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put
herself forward.  The two girls had been whispering to each
other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that
the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his
first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine
complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her
mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early
age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural
self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom
her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended
her, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,
therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball,
and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would
be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their
mother's ear.

"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement,
and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please,
name the very day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be
dancing while she is ill."

Lydia declared herself satisfied.  "Oh!  yes -- it would be
much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most
likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you
have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their
giving one also.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite
a shame if he does not."

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth
returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations'
behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the
latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in
their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms
on _fine_ _eyes_.

                              __

<CHAPTER X (10)>

THE day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst
and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the
invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the
evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room.  The
loo table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and
Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his
letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to
his sister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.
Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently
amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his
companion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady either
on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on
the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with
which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue,
and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"

He made no answer.

"You write uncommonly fast."

"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly."

"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course
of the year!  Letters of business too!  How odious I should
think them!"

"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of
to yours."

"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."

"I have already told her so once, by your desire."

"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.
I mend pens remarkably well."

"Thank you -- but I always mend my own."

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent.

"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement
on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures
with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it
infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."

"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write
again? -- At present I have not room to do them justice."

"Oh!  it is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.
But do you always write such charming long letters to her,
Mr. Darcy?"

"They are generally long; but whether always charming,
it is not for me to determine."

"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long
letter, with ease, cannot write ill."

"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried
her brother -- "because he does _not_ write with ease.  He
studies too much for words of four syllables. -- Do not you,
Darcy?"

"My stile of writing is very different from yours."

"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless
way imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the
rest."

"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them
-- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all
to my correspondents."

"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm
reproof."

"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance
of humility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and
sometimes an indirect boast."

"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of
modesty?"

"The indirect boast; -- for you are really proud of your
defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding
from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which
if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The
power of doing any thing with quickness is always much
prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the
imperfection of the performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet
this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort
of panegyric, of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is
there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very
necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage
to yourself or any one else?"

"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night
all the foolish things that were said in the morning.  And yet,
upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true,
and I believe it at this moment.  At least, therefore, I did
not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to
shew off before the ladies."

"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced
that you would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would
be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and
if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,
``Bingley, you had better stay till next week,'' you would
probably do it, you would probably not go -- and, at another
word, might stay a month."

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.
Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have
shewn him off now much more than he did himself."

"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting
what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my
temper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that
gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think
the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a
flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."

"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original
intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"

"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must
speak for himself."

"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call
mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the case,
however, to stand according to your representation, you must
remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to
desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has
merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in
favour of its propriety."

"To yield readily -- easily -- to the _persuasion_ of a friend
is no merit with you."

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the
understanding of either."

"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the
influence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the
requester would often make one readily yield to a request
without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.  I am not
particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about
Mr. Bingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his
behaviour thereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between
friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to
change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think
ill of that person for complying with the desire, without
waiting to be argued into it?"

"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject,
to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance
which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of
intimacy subsisting between the parties?"

"By all means," cried Bingley; "Let us hear all the
particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size;
for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet,
than you may be aware of.  I assure you that if Darcy were not
such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should
not pay him half so much deference.  I declare I do not know a
more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday
evening when he has nothing to do."

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that
he was rather offended; and therefore checked he laugh.  Miss
Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an
expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.

"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. -- "You dislike
an argument, and want to silence this."

"Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you
and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I
shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like
of me."

"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side;
and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter,"

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and
Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved
with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request
that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely
and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus
employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned
over some music books that lay on the instrument, how
frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly
knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration
to so great man; and yet that he should look at her because he
disliked her was still more strange.  She could only imagine
however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was a
something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to
his ideas of right, than in any other person present.  The
supposition did not pain her.  She liked him too little to care
for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm
by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing
near Elizabeth, said to her --

"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize
such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"

She smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with
some surprise at her silence.

"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not
immediately determine what to say in reply.  You wanted me,
I know, to say ``Yes,'' that you might have the pleasure of
despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing
those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their
premeditated contempt.  I have therefore made up my mind to
tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and
now despise me if you dare."

"Indeed I do not dare."

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed
at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and
archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to
affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any
woman as he was by her.  He really believed, that were it not
for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some
danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her
great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received
some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by
talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness
in such an alliance.

"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the
shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a
few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the
advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do
cure the younger girls of running after the officers. -- And,
if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that
little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which
your lady possesses."

"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"

"Oh!  yes. -- Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt
Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next
to your great uncle, the judge.  They are in the same
profession, you know; only in different lines.  As for your
Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"

"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but
their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine,
might be copied."

At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst
and Elizabeth herself.

"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley,
in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.

"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running
away without telling us that you were coming out."  Then taking
the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by
herself.  The path just admitted three.

Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said, --

"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go
into the avenue."

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with
them, laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are. -- You are charmingly group'd, and
appear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be spoilt
by admitting a fourth.  Good bye."

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the
hope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already
so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of
hours that evening.

                              __

<CHAPTER XI (11)>

WHEN the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and, seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her
into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two
friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had
never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which
passed before the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of
conversation were considerable.  They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour,
and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first
object.  Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards
Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had
advanced many steps.  He addressed himself directly to Miss
Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a
slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and
warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.  He was full of joy
and attention.  The first half hour was spent in piling up the
fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she
removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that
she might be farther from the door.  He then sat down by her,
and talked scarcely to any one else.  Elizabeth, at work in the
opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table -- but in vain.  She had obtained private
intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and
Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.  She
assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of
the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.
Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on
one of the sophas and go to sleep.  Darcy took up a book; Miss
Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in
playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in
her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.

Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching
Mr. Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking
at his page.  She could not win him, however, to any
conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her
own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second
volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there
is no enjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of any
thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall
be miserable if I have not an excellent library."

No one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside
her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some
amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss
Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,

"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a
dance at Netherfield? -- I would advise you, before you
determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party;
I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a
ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if
he chuses, before it begins -- but as for the ball, it is quite
a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup
enough I shall send round my cards."

"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they
were carried on in a different manner; but there is something
insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead
of dancing made the order of the day."

"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would
not be near so much like a ball."

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and
walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she walked
well; -- but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still
inflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings she
resolved on one effort more; and turning to Elizabeth, said,

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,
and take a turn about the room. -- I assure you it is very
refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss
Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility;
Mr. Darcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of
attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and
unconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join
their party, but he declined it, observing that he could
imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining
them would interfere.  "What could he mean?  she was dying to
know what could be his meaning" -- and asked Elizabeth whether
she could at all understand him?

"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to
be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will
be to ask nothing about it."

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy
in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an
explanation of his two motives.

"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said
he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.  "You either chuse
this method of passing the evening because you are in each
other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or
because you are conscious that your figures appear to the
greatest advantage in walking; -- if the first, I should be
completely in your way; -- and if the second, I can admire you
much better as I sit by the fire."

"Oh!  shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.  "I never heard any thing
so abominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?"

"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said
Elizabeth.  "We can all plague and punish one another.  Teaze
him -- laugh at him. -- Intimate as you are, you must know how
it is to be done."

"But upon my honour I do _not_.  I do assure you that my
intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.  Teaze calmness of
temper and presence of mind!  No, no -- I feel he may defy us
there.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if
you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.
Mr. Darcy may hug himself."

"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.  "That is
an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,
for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such
acquaintance.  I dearly love a laugh."

"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than
can be.  The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and
best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person
whose first object in life is a joke."

"Certainly," replied Elizabeth -- "there are such people, but I
hope I am not one of _them_.  I hope I never ridicule what is
wise or good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies
_do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. --
But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."

"Perhaps that is not possible for any one.  But it has been the
study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a
strong understanding to ridicule."

"Such as vanity and pride."

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride -- where there is
a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good
regulation."

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley; -- "and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.
He owns it himself without disguise."

"No" -- said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.  I have
faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
My temper I dare not vouch for. -- It is I believe too little
yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the
world.  I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon
as I ought, nor their offences against myself.  My feelings are
not puffed about with every attempt to move them.  My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. -- My good opinion once lost
is lost for ever."

"_That_ is a failing indeed!" -- cried Elizabeth.  "Implacable
resentment _is_ a shade in a character.  But you have chosen
your fault well. -- I really cannot _laugh_ at it; you are safe
from me."

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some
particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best
education can overcome."

"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."

"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to
misunderstand them."

"Do let us have a little music," -- cried Miss Bingley, tired
of a conversation in which she had no share. -- "Louisa, you
will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst."

Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte
was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was
not sorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying
Elizabeth too much attention.

                              __

<CHAPTER XII (12)>

IN consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth
wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage
might be sent for them in the course of the day.  But
Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at
Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly
finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive hem with
pleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get
home.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly
have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was
added that, if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay
longer, she could spare them very well. -- Against staying
longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did
she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves
needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's
carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their
original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be
mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and
enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the
following day, to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going
was deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had
proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister
much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were
to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet
that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough
recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be
right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence -- Elizabeth had been
at Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he
liked -- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more
teazing than usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be
particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_
escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had
been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have
material weight in confirming or crushing it.  Steady to his
purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole
of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by
themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to
his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable
to almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley's civility to
Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her
affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the
latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her
either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. -- Elizabeth
took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.
Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very
wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have
caught cold again. -- But their father, though very laconic in
his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he
had felt their importance in the family circle.  The evening
conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane
and Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass
and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some
new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different
sort.  Much had been done and much had been said in the
regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged,
and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married.

                              __

<CHAPTER XIII (13)>

"I HOPE my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good
dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to
our family party."

"Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,
I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and
I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe
she often sees such at home."

"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."

Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. -- "A gentleman and a stranger!
It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure.  Why Jane -- you never dropt a
word of this; you sly thing!  Well, I am sure I shall be
extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. -- But -- good lord!  how
unlucky!  there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia,
my love, ring the bell.  I must speak to Hill, this moment."

"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person
whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure
of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at
once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained.  "About a month ago I received this letter, and
about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of
some delicacy, and requiring early attention.  It is from my
cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out
of this house as soon as he pleases."

"Oh!  my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that
mentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it
is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be
entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had
been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other
about it."

Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an
entail.  They had often attempted it before, but it was a
subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason;
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of
settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in
favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet,
"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting
Longbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may
perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing
himself."

"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very
impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very
hypocritical.  I hate such false friends.  Why could not he
keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"

"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples
on that head, as you will hear."

"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,

15th October.

DEAR SIR,

THE disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late
honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I
have had the misfortune to lose him I have frequently wished to
heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own
doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory
for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always
pleased him to be at variance." -- "There, Mrs. Bennet." --
"My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to
be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty
and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of
this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean
myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever
ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
instituted by the Church of England.  As a clergyman, moreover,
I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of
peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of
good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of
my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly
overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
olive branch.  I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being
the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to
make them every possible amends, -- but of this hereafter.  If
you should have no objection to receive me into your house,
I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your
family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall
probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
se'nnight following, which I can do without any inconvenience,
as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional
absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is
engaged to do the duty of the day.  I remain, dear sir, with
respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
well-wisher and friend,

WILLIAM COLLINS."

"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peacemaking
gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon
my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,
especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let
him come to us again."

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however;
and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be
the person to discourage him."

"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way
he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the
wish is certainly to his credit."

Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference
for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening,
marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were
required.

"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.  "I cannot make him
out. -- There is something very pompous in his stile. -- And
what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?
-- We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. -- Can he
be a sensible man, sir?"

"No, my dear; I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him
quite the reverse.  There is a mixture of servility and
self-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am
impatient to see him."

"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.  The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly
new, yet I think it is well expressed."

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were
in any degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that
their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some
weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a
man in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins's
letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was
preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with
great politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet, indeed, said
little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.
Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined
to be silent himself.  He was a tall, heavy looking young man
of five and twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his
manners were very formal.  He had not been long seated before
he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in
this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added,
that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well
disposed of in marriage.  This gallantry was not much to the
taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs. Bennet who quarrelled
with no compliments, answered most readily,

"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my
heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.
Things are settled so oddly."

"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."

"Ah!  sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor
girls, you must confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with
_you_, for such things, I know, are all chance in this world.
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to
be entailed."

"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,
-- and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of
appearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young
ladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will
not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted -- "

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls
smiled on each other.  They were not the only objects of Mr.
Collins's admiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its
furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of
every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the
mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future
property.  The dinner too, in its turn, was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence
of its cookery was owing.  But here he was set right by
Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were
very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had
nothing to do in the kitchen.  He begged pardon for having
displeased her.  In a softened tone she declared herself not at
all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter
of an hour.

                              __

<CHAPTER XIV (14)>

DURING dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the
servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some
conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in
which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed
very fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh's
attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,
appeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject
elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a
most important aspect he protested that he had never in his
life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such
affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced
from Lady Catherine.  She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the
honour of preaching before her.  She had also asked him twice
to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday
before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady
Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_
had never seen any thing but affability in her.  She had always
spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not
the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a
week or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended
to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose
with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble
parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations
he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some
herself, -- some shelves in the closets up stairs.

"That is all very proper and civil I am sure," said
Mrs. Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.  It
is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.
Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only
by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."

"I think you said she was a widow, sir?  has she any family?"

"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."

"Ah!" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better
off than many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  is
she handsome?"

"She is a most charming young lady indeed.  Lady Catherine
herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is
far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is
that in her features which marks the young woman of
distinguished birth.  She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in
many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed
of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her
education, and who still resides with them.  But she is
perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble
abode in her little phaeton and ponies."

"Has she been presented?  I do not remember her name among the
ladies at court."

"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being
in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one
day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine
that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little
delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the
most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be
adorned by her. -- These are the kind of little things which
please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I
conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."

"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy
for you that you possess the talent of flattering with
delicacy.  May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous
study?"

"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and
though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging
such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary
occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as
possible."

Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was
as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the
keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most
resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional
glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.

By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet
was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and
when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the
ladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced;
but on beholding it (for every thing announced it to be from a
circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,
protested that he never read novels. -- Kitty stared at him,
and Lydia exclaimed. -- Other books were produced, and after
some deliberation he chose Fordyce's _Sermons_.  Lydia gaped as
he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous
solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,

"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away
Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.  My
aunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton
to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny
comes back from town."

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue;
but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested
by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their
benefit.  It amazes me, I confess; -- for certainly, there can
be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.  But I will
no longer importune my young cousin."

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his
antagonist at backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge,
observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to
their own trifling amusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters
apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised
that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book;
but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young
cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as
any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet,
and prepared for backgammon.

                              __

<CHAPTER XV (15)>

MR. COLLINS was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of
nature had been but little assisted by education or society;
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the
guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he
belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the
necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.
The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given
him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and
unexpected prosperity.  A fortunate chance had recommended him
to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was
vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his
veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good
opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his
rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and
obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended
to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn
family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the
daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they
were represented by common report.  This was his plan of amends
-- of atonement -- for inheriting their father's estate; and he
thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his
own part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them. -- Miss Bennet's lovely
face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest
notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening
she was his settled choice.  The next morning, however, made an
alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's te^te-a`-te^te with
Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his
parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his
hopes that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn,
produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed
on. -- "As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon
her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did
not _know_ of any prepossession; -- her _eldest_ daughter, she
must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was
likely to be very soon engaged."

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it
was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded
her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might
soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not
bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good
graces.

Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;
every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins
was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most
anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for
thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there
he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest
folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet,
with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.
Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library
he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though
prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit
in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from
them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in
inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and
Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than
a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book,
and go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of
his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The
attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained
by _him_.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the
street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very
smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window,
could recall them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,
whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike
appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the
way.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose
return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they
passed.  All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered
who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to
find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just
gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and
entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who
had returned with him the day before from town, and he was
happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps.  This
was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only
regimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance
was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty
-- a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing
address.  The introduction was followed up on his side by a
happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time
perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were
still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the
sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street.  On distinguishing the ladies of
the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities.  Bingley was the principal
spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.  He was then,
he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after
her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning
to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were
suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each
other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.  Both
changed colour, one looked white, the other red.  Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr.
Darcy just deigned to return.  What could be the meaning of it?
-- It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long
to know.

In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have
noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the
door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite
of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in,
and even in spite of Mrs. Philips' throwing up the parlour
window and loudly seconding the invitation.

Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two
eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome,
and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden
return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them,
she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to
see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that
they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because
the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.  She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned
with as much more, apologising for his intrusion without any
previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help
flattering himself, however, might be justified by his
relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her
notice.  Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an
end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew,
that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to
have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.  She had been
watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down
the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would
certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one
passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in
comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable
fellows."  Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on
Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family
from Longbourn would come in the evening.  This was agreed to,
and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice
comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of
hot supper afterwards.  The prospect of such delights was very
cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins
repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had
seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have
defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she
could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins, on his return, highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by
admiring Mrs. Philips's manners and politeness.  He protested
that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen
a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with
the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her
invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to
her before.  Something he supposed might be attributed to his
connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.

                              __

<CHAPTER XVI (16)>

As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with
their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and
Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most
steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins
at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure
of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham
had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the
house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their
seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and
admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture
of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have
supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at
Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened
to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's
drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost
eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment,
and would hardly have resented a comparison with the
housekeeper's room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her
mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own
humble abode and the improvements it was receiving, he was
happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found
in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his
consequence increased with what she heard, and who was
resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she
could.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and
who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and
examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the
mantlepiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It
was over at last however.  The gentlemen did approach; and when
Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had
neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with
the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.  The officers
of the -----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present
party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person,
countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the
broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who
followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female
eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he
finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he
immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its
being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season,
made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare
topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the
speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and
the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into
insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing;
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips,
and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with
coffee and muffin.

When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity
of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.

"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall
be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life --"
Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could
not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was
he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At
first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely
for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise
extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much
interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming
after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very
willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she
could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with
Mr. Darcy.  She dared not even mention that gentleman.  Her
curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.  Mr. Wickham began
the subject himself.  He inquired how far Netherfield was from
Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an
hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let
the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property
in Derbyshire, I understand."

"Yes," replied Wickham; -- "his estate there is a noble one.
A clear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with
a person more capable of giving you certain information on
that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his
family in a particular manner from my infancy."

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,
after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of
our meeting yesterday. -- Are you much acquainted with
Mr. Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly, --
"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I
think him very disagreeable."

"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to
his being agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form
one.  I have known him too long and to well to be a fair judge.
It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.  But I believe your
opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you
would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. -- Here
you are in your own family."

"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any
house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at
all liked in Hertfordshire.  Every body is disgusted with his
pride.  You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any
one."

"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated
beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not
often happen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and
consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners,
and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."

"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."  Wickham only shook his head.

"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,
"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."

"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away
when I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the
----shire will not be affected by his being in the
neighbourhood."

"Oh!  no -- it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.  We are not
on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but
I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim
to all the world; a sense of very great ill-usage, and most
painful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss
Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever
breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to
the soul by a thousand tender recollections.  His behaviour
to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could
forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his
disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his
father."

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and
listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented
farther inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all
that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially,
with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.

"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he
added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my
friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their
present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent
acquaintance Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is
necessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my
spirits will not bear solitude.  I _must_ have employment and
society.  A military life is not what I was intended for, but
circumstances have now made it eligible.  The church _ought_
to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church,
and I should at this time have been in possession of a most
valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking
of just now."

"Indeed!"

"Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation
of the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and
excessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his
kindness.  He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had
done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."

"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be? --
How could his will be disregarded? -- Why did not you seek
legal redress?"

"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest
as to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not have
doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to
treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert
that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,
imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.  Certain it is, that
the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an
age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having
really done any thing to deserve to lose it.  I have a warm,
unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my
opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.  I can recall
nothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different
sort of men, and that he hates me."

"This is quite shocking! -- He deserves to be publicly
disgraced."

"Some time or other he _will_ be -- but it shall not be by
_me_.  Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose
_him_."

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him
handsomer than ever as he expressed them.

"But what," said she after a pause, "can have been his motive?
-- what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"

"A thorough, determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I
cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late
Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me
better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated
him I believe very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear
the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of
preference which was often given me."

"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I
have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him --
I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in
general, but did not suspect him of descending to such
malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"

After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the
implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving
temper.  His disposition must be dreadful."

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham,
"_I_ can hardly be just to him."

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time
exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the godson, the friend,
the favourite of his father!" -- She could have added, "A young
man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your
being amiable" -- but she contented herself with "And one, too,
who had probably been his own companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner!"

"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the
greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the
same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same
parental care.  _My_ father began life in the profession which
your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to -- but
he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and
devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He
was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,
confidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged.  himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active
superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death,
Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I
am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude
to _him_, as of affection to myself."

"How strange!" cried Elizabeth.  "How abominable! -- I wonder
that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to
you! -- If from no better motive, that he should not have been
too proud to be dishonest, -- for dishonesty I must call it."

"It _is_ wonderful," -- replied Wickham, -- "for almost all his
actions may be traced to pride; -- and pride has often been his
best friend.  It has connected him nearer with virtue than any
other feeling.  But we are none of us consistent; and in his
behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."

"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"

"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, -- to
give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his
tenants, and relieve the poor.  Family pride, and _filial_
pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done
this.  Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from
the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley
House, is a powerful motive.  He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind
and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him
generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."

"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy,?"

He shook his head. -- "I wish I could call her amiable.  It
gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much
like her brother, -- very, very proud. -- As a child, she was
affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have
devoted hours and hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing
to me now.  She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished.  Since her father's
death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth
could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can
Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really
believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How
can they suit each other? -- Do you know Mr. Bingley?"

"Not at all."

"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot know
what Mr. Darcy is."

"Probably not; -- but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.  He
does not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if
he thinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his
equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he
is to the less prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but
with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational,
honourable, and perhaps agreeable, -- allowing something for
fortune and figure."

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players
gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his
station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. -- The
usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.  It
had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when
Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and
begged she would not make herself uneasy.

"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit
down to a card table, they must take their chance of these
things, -- and happily I am not in such circumstances as to
make five shillings any object.  There are undoubtedly many
who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."

Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing
Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low
voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with
the family of de Bourgh.

"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately
given him a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first
introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known
her long."

"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady
Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to
the present Mr. Darcy."

"No, indeed, I did not. -- I knew nothing at all of Lady
Catherine's connections.  I never heard of her existence till
the day before yesterday."

"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,
and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two
estates."

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor
Miss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and
useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself,
if he were already self-destined to another.

"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine
and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related
of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that
in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant,
conceited woman."

"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham;
"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember
that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial
and insolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably
sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of
her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her
authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her
nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should
have an understanding of the first class."

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of
it, and they continued talking together with mutual
satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest
of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.  There
could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips's supper
party, but his manners recommended him to every body.  Whatever
he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.  She could think
of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention
his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were
once silent.  Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of
the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr.
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips,
protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at
whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly
fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he
could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn
House.

                              __

<CHAPTER XVII (17)>

ELIZABETH related to Jane the next day, what had passed between
Mr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and
concern; -- she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be
so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her
nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable
appearance as Wickham. -- The possibility of his having really
endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender
feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to
think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could
not be otherwise explained.

"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say,
in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the
other.  It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture
the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."

"Very true, indeed; -- and now, my dear Jane, what have you got
to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably
been concerned in the business? -- Do clear _them_ too, or we
shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."

"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of
my opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a
disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his
father's favourite in such a manner, -- one, whom his father
had promised to provide for. -- It is impossible.  No man of
common humanity, no man who had any value for his character,
could be capable of it.  Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?  oh!  no."

"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on,
than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself
as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned
without ceremony. -- If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict
it.  Besides, there was truth in his looks."

"It is difficult indeed -- it is distressing. -- One does not
know what to think."

"I beg your pardon; -- one knows exactly what to think."

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point, -- that
Mr. Bingley, if he _had_ _been_ imposed on, would have much to
suffer when the affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where
this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very
persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his
sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long
expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following
Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their dear
friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since
their separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little
attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not
much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were
soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which
took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to
escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to
every female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it
as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was
particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from
Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card; Jane
pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two
friends, and the attention of their brother; and Elizabeth
thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham,
and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's
looks and behaviour.  The happiness anticipated by Catherine
and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular
person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance
half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only
partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a
ball.  And even Mary could assure her family that she had no
disinclination for it.

"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is
enough. -- I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in
evening engagements.  Society has claims on us all; and
I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of
recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion that, though
she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could
not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's
invitation, and, if he did, whether he would think it proper to
join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised
to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head,
and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the
Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.

"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a
ball of this kind, given by a young man of character to
respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far
from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be
honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of
the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,
Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, -- a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the
right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully
proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances: -- and
to have Mr. Collins instead!  her liveliness had been never
worse timed.  There was no help for it however.  Mr. Wickham's
happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and
Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she
could.  She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from
the idea it suggested of something more. -- It now first struck
her that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to
form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more
eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as she
observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard
his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity;
and though more astonished than gratified herself by this
effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave
her to understand that the probability of their marriage was
exceedingly agreeable to _her_.  Elizabeth, however, did not
chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute
must be the consequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never
make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel
about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and
talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable
state at this time, for from the day of the invitation to the
day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as
prevented their walking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers,
no news could be sought after; -- the very shoe-roses for
Netherfield were got by proxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found
some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended
the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and
nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and
Lydia.

                              __

<CHAPTER XVIII (18)>

TILL Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and
looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats
there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never
occurred to her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been
checked by any of those recollections that might not
unreasonably have alarmed her.  She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the
conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting
that it was not more than might be won in the course of the
evening.  But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his
being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the
Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not
exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly
applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go
to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;
adding, with a significant smile,

"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just
now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was
caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not
less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise
had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former
was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could
hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries
which he directly afterwards approached to make. -- Attention,
forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not
wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind
partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every
prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not
dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to
Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon
able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her
cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The two
first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
dances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery
which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.
The moment of her release from him was exstacy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of
talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally
liked.  When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte
Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself
suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by
surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing
what she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of
presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.

"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."

"Heaven forbid! -- _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of
all! -- To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
-- Do not wish me such an evil."

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to
claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a
whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham
to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times
his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place
in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in
being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in
her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began
to imagine that their silence was to last through the two
dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till
suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to
her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight
observation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.
After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with:

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. -- _I_
talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of
remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say
should be said.

"Very well. -- That reply will do for the present. -- Perhaps
by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter
than public ones. -- But _now_ we may be silent."

"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"

"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look
odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet
for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so
arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little
as as possible."

"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case,
or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"

"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a
great similarity in the turn of our minds. -- We are each of an
unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we
expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be
handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."

"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character,
I am sure," said he.  "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot
pretend to say. -- _You_ think it a faithful portrait
undoubtedly."

"I must not decide on my own performance."

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had
gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters
did not very often walk to Meryton.  She answered in the
affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When
you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new
acquaintance."

The effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur overspread
his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though
blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.  At
length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,

"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure
his _making_ friends -- whether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain."

"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied
Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to
suffer from all his life."

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the
subject.  At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to
them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the
room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of
superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his
partner.

"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.  Such
very superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that
you belong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however,
that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must
hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a
certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing at her
sister and Bingley), shall take place.  What congratulations
will then flow in!  I appeal to Mr. Darcy: -- but let me not
interrupt you, Sir. -- You will not thank me for detaining you
from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright
eyes are also upbraiding me."

The latter part of this address was scarcely, heard by Darcy;
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him
forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious
expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,
and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were
talking of."

"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could
not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less
to say for themselves. -- We have tried two or three subjects
already without success, and what we are to talk of next I
cannot imagine."

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.

"Books -- Oh!  no. -- I am sure we never read the same, or not
with the same feelings."

"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at
least be no want of subject. -- We may compare our different
opinions."

"No -- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is
always full of something else."

"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it?"
said he, with a look of doubt.

"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she
said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject,
as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,

"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly
ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.  You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its
_being_ _created_."

"I am," said he, with a firm voice.

"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"

"I hope not."

"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change
their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she,
endeavouring to shake off her gravity.  "I am trying to make it
out."

"And what is your success?"

She shook her head.  "I do not get on at all.  I hear such
different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."

"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report
may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss
Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present
moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would
reflect no credit on either."

"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have
another opportunity."

"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he
coldly replied.  She said no more, and they went down the
other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied,
though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was
a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured
her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.

They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her,
and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham! -- Your sister has been talking to me about him, and
asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man
forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was
the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.  Let me
recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit
confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using
him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr. Darcy, in a most infamous manner.  I do not know
the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in
the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham
mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well
avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was
excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the
way.  His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent
thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favorite's
guilt; but really, considering his descent one could not expect
much better."

"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the
same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him
of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward,
and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself."

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a
sneer.  "Excuse my interference. -- It was kindly meant."

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. -- "You are much
mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack
as this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and
the malice of Mr. Darcy."  She then sought her eldest sister,
who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of
Bingley.  Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency,
a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how
well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. --
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies and
every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in
the fairest way for happiness.

"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling
than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of
any third person, in which case you may be sure of my pardon."

"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have
nothing satisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know
the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the
circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he
will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his
friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has
deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as
his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young
man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved
to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."

"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"

"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."

"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.
I am perfectly satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?"

"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though
he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he
believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only."

"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth
warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by
assurances only.  Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a
very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with
several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that
friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both
gentlemen as I did before."

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to
each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest
hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all
in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being
joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss
Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up
to them and told her with great exultation that he had just
been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.

"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that
there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.  I
happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the
young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his
cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How
wonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have thought
of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! -- I am most thankful that the
discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,
which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not
having done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection
must plead my apology."

"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?"

"Indeed I am.  I shall intreat his pardon for not having done
it earlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.  It
will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite
well yesterday se'nnight."

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme;
assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing
him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather
than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least
necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that
if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. -- Mr. Collins listened
to her with the determined air of following his own inclination
and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the
world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the
scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there
must be a wide difference between the established forms of
ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the
clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the
clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest
rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained.  You must therefore
allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this
occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point
of duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,
which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a
young lady like yourself."  And with a low bow he left her to
attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly
watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very
evident.  Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and
though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing
it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." -- It vexed her to
see him expose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed
him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again,
and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the
length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made
him a slight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then
returned to Elizabeth.

"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied
with my reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the
attention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even
paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced
of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could
never bestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very
handsome thought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,
she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and
Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her
observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as
Jane.  She saw her, in idea, settled in that very house, in all
the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow;
and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
even to like Bingley's two sisters.  Her mother's thoughts she
plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat
down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky
perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and
deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to
that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to
Mr. Bingley. -- It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.  His being such a charming young man, and so rich,
and living but three miles from them, were the first points of
self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how
fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they
must desire the connection as much as she could do.  It was,
moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other
rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to
be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their
sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more
than she liked.  It was necessary to make this circumstance a
matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the
etiquette but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find
comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.  She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be
equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing
there was no chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her
mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a
less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she
could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.
Darcy, who sat opposite to them.  Her mother only scolded her
for being nonsensical.

"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of
him?  I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to
be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear."

"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. -- What advantage can
it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? -- You will never recommend
yourself to his friend by so doing."

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.  Her
mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy,
though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for
though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The
expression of his face changed gradually from indignant
contempt to a composed and steady gravity.

At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady
Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights
which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the
comforts of cold ham and chicken.  Elizabeth now began to
revive.  But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for
when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the
mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.  By many significant looks and
silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance, -- but in vain; Mary would not understand them;
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and
she began her song.  Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with
most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through
the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill
rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the
thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a
minute began another.  Mary's powers were by no means fitted
for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner
affected. -- Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at Jane, to
see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued
however impenetrably grave.  She looked at her father to
entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all
night.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second
song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child.  You have delighted us
long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;
and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech,
was afraid her anxiety had done no good. -- Others of the party
were now applied to.

"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to
sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the
company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent
diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a
clergyman. -- I do not mean however to assert that we can be
justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there
are certainly other things to be attended to.  The rector of a
parish has much to do. -- In the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.  He must write his own sermons; and
the time that remains will not be too much for his parish
duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he
cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.  And
I do not think it of light importance that he should have
attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.
I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of
the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect
towards any body connected with the family."  And with a bow to
Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so
loud as to be heard by half the room. -- Many stared. -- Many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself,
while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady
Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement
to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening,
it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with
more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for
Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped
his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much
distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.  That his
two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an
opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she
could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more
intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was
teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her
side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with
him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In
vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and
offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.  He
assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to
it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to
recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a
point of remaining close to her the whole evening.  There was
no arguing upon such a project.  She owed her greatest relief
to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther
notice; though often standing within a very short distance of
her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to
Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart;
and by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their
carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone,
which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away
by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely
opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were
evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They
repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by
so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very
little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was
complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of
their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which
had marked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing
at all.  Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached
from the rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth
preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss
Bingley; and even Lydia was to much fatigued to utter more than
the occasional exclamation of "Lord how tired I am!"
accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most
pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at
Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley,
to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family
dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal
invitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily
engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,
after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the
next day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house
under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the
necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and
wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter
settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.
Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal,
pleasure.  Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her
children; and though the man and the match were quite good
enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley
and Netherfield.

                              __

<CHAPTER XIX (19)>

THE next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins
made his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without
loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the
following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to
make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set
about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances
which he supposed a regular part of the business.  On finding
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter
Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience
with her in the course of this morning?"

Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of
surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,

"Oh dear! -- Yes -- certainly. -- I am sure Lizzy will be very
happy -- I am sure she can have no objection. -- Come, Kitty,
I want you up stairs."  And gathering her work together, she
was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,

"Dear Ma'am, do not go. -- I beg you will not go. -- Mr.
Collins must excuse me. -- He can have nothing to say to me
that any body need not hear.  I am going away myself."

"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. -- I desire you will stay where
you are." -- And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed
and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy,
I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest
to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down
again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the
feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.
Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone
Mr. Collins began.

"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far
from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other
perfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had
there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to
assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for
this address.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my
discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the
companion of my future life.  But before I am run away with by
my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for
me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming
into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I
certainly did."

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being
run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing
that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any
attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right
thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself)
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.  Secondly, that
I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and
thirdly -- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier,
that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very
noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice
has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on
this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before
I left Hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille, while
Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that
she said, ``Mr. Collins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you
must marry. -- Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_
sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of
person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go
a good way.  This is my advice.  Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.''  Allow
me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not
reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as
among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.  You
will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your
wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially
when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will
inevitably excite.  Thus much for my general intention in
favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were
directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact
is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death
of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years
longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse
a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be
as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place --
which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several
years.  This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter
myself it will not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing
remains-for me but to assure you in the most animated language
of the violence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly
indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your
father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied
with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents, which
will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that
you may ever be entitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall
be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no
ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are
married."

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.  "You forget that I have
made no answer.  Let me do it without farther loss of time.
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me, I am
very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is
impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."

"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal
wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject
the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept,
when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the
refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.  I am
therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said,
and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."

"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that
I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there
are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance
of being asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my
refusal. -- You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced
that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so,
-- Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am
persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for
the situation."

"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said
Mr. Collins very gravely -- "but I cannot imagine that her
ladyship would at all disapprove of you.  And you may be
certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall
speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other
amiable qualifications."

"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the
compliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and
very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to
prevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must
have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my
family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it
falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."  And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.
Collins thus addressed her,

"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this
subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than
you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of
cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established
custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application,
and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit
as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female
character."

"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth,
"you puzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can
appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to
express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its
being one."

"You must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that
your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My
reasons for believing it are briefly these: -- It does not
appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that
the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly
desirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the
family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, it into
farther consideration that in spite of your manifold
attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of
marriage may ever be made you.  Your portion is unhappily so
small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your
loveliness and amiable qualifications.  As I must therefore
conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my
love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant
females."

"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to
that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a
respectable man.  I would rather be paid the compliment of
being believed sincere.  I thank you again and again for the
honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them
is absolutely impossible.  My feelings in every respect forbid
it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature
speaking the truth from her heart."

"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the
express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals
will not fail of being acceptable."

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would
make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;
determined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated
refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,
whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be
decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken
for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

                              __

<CHAPTER XX (20)>

MR. COLLINS was not left long to the silent contemplation of
his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in
the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner
saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her
towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast room, and
congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy
prospect of their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and
returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with
the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be
satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had stedfastly
given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the
genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; -- she would
have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had
meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but
she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.

"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall
be brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it myself
directly.  She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not
know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it."

"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins;
"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not
whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man
in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the
marriage state.  If therefore she actually persists in
rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into
accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she
could not contribute much to my felicity."

"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In every
thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.  I will
go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it
with her, I am sure."

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to
her husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh!  Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an
uproar.  You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for
she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he
will change his mind and not have _her_."

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and
fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in
the least altered by her communication.

"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he,
when she had finished her speech.  "Of what are you talking?"

"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have
Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not
have Lizzy."

"And what am I to do on the occasion? -- It seems an hopeless
business."

"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist
upon her marrying him."

"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion."

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to
the library.

"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.  "I have
sent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.
Collins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?"
Elizabeth replied that it was.  "Very well -- and this offer of
marriage you have refused?"

"I have, Sir."

"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists
upon your accepting it.  Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?"

"Yes, or I will never see her again."

"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this
day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. -- Your
mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr.
Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a
beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her
husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively
disappointed.

"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him."

"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to
request.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my
understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my
room.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as
may be."

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her
husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to
Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest but Jane with
all possible mildness declined interfering; -- and Elizabeth,
sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful
gaiety, replied to her attacks.  Though her manner varied,
however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had
passed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what
motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was
hurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was
quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her
mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came
to spend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by
Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad
you are come, for there is such fun here! -- What do you think
has happened this morning? -- Mr. Collins has made an offer to
Lizzy, and she will not have him."

Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by
Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they
entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than
she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for
her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy
to comply with the wishes of all her family.  "Pray do, my dear
Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on
my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody
feels for my poor nerves."

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and
Elizabeth.

"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as
unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we
were at York, provided she can have her own way. -- But I tell
you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on
refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never
get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to
maintain you when your father is dead. -- _I_ shall not be able
to keep you -- and so I warn you. -- I have done with you from
this very day. -- I told you in the library, you know, that
I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good
as my word.  I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful
children, -- Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to
any body.  People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.  Nobody can tell
what I suffer! -- But it is always so.  Those who do not
complain are never pitied."

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible
that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only
increase the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without
interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr.
Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and
on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your
tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation
together."

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty
followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all
she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of
Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family
were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied
herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.
In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
conversation. -- "Oh!  Mr. Collins!" --

"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this
point.  Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice
that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your
daughter.  Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us
all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate
as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive
happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value
in our estimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as
shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus
withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without
having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of
requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.  My
conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.  But
we are all liable to error.  I have certainly meant well
through the whole affair.  My object has been to secure an
amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the
advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at
all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."

                              __

<CHAPTER XXI (21)>

THE discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end,
and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable
feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some
peevish allusion of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself,
his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or
dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of
manner and resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her,
and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss
Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable
relief to them all, and especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or
ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry
pride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten
his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by
it.  He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he
still meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if
Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from
the Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the
town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and
vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked
over. -- To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.

"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better
not meet Mr. Darcy; -- that to be in the same room, the same
party with him for so many hours together, might be more than
I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more
than myself."

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a
full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they
civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer
walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he
particularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a
double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to
herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of
introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;
it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.  The
envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed
paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it,
and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away,
tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general
conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject
which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner
had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs.  When they had gained
their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,

"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised
me a good deal.  The whole party have left Netherfield by this
time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention
of coming back again.  You shall hear what she says."

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the
information of their having just resolved to follow their
brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day
in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was
in these words.  "I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall
leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns
of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and
most unreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that."  To
these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the
insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their
removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament;
it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield
would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of
their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you
should not be able to see your friends before they leave the
country.  But may we not hope that the period of future
happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive
earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse
you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? -- Mr. Bingley will not be detained
in London by them."

"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return
into Hertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you -- "

"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the
business which took him to London, might be concluded in three
or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the
same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be
in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following
him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant
hours in a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud,
but of that I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in
Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season
generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to
prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall
deprive you."

"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no
more this winter."

"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he
_should_."

"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing. -- He is his
own master.  But you do not know _all_.  I _will_ read you the
passage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves
from _you_."  "Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to
confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her
again.  I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for
beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she
inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something
still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.  I do not know whether I ever
before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will
not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you
will not esteem them unreasonable.  My brother admires her
greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of
seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish
the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is
not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of
engaging any woman's heart.  With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my
dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will
secure the happiness of so many?"

"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?" -- said
Jane as she finished it.  "Is it not clear enough? -- Does it
not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes
me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her
brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of
my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my
guard?  Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"

"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. -- Will you
hear it?"

"Most willingly."

"You shall have it in few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her
brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and
tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."

Jane shook her head.

"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. -- No one who has ever
seen you together, can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley I am
sure cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen
half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have
ordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this.  We are not
rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more
anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less
trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some
ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh
were out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot
seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her
brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of
you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him
that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love
with her friend."

"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.  But I
know the foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of
wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this
case is, that she is deceived herself."

"That is right. -- You could not have started a more happy
idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to
be deceived by all means.  You have now done your duty by her,
and must fret no longer."

"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best,
in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing
him to marry elsewhere?"

"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if, upon
mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging
his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of
being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."

"How can you talk so?" -- said Jane faintly smiling, -- "You
must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their
disapprobation, I could not hesitate."

"I did not think you would; -- and that being the case,
I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.  A thousand things may arise in six months!"

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the
utmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of
Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment
suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,
could influence a young man so totally independent of every
one.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she
felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its
happy effect.  Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was
gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection
sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to
Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure
of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the
gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave
her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly
unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they
were all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it
however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at
Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable
declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family
dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.

                              __

<CHAPTER XXII (22)>

THE Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again
during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to
listen to Mr. Collins.  Elizabeth took an opportunity of
thanking her.  "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I
am more obliged to you than I can express."  Charlotte assured
her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it
amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.  This
was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther
than Elizabeth had any conception of; -- its object was nothing
less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's
addresses, by engaging them towards herself.  Such was Miss
Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when
they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of
success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the
next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge
to throw himself at her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the
notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him
depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he
was not willing to have the attempt known till its success
could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and
with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he
was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.  Miss
Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards
the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in
the lane.  But little had she dared to hope that so much love
and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of
both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her
to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and
though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the
lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The
stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his
courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the
pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not
how soon that establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their
consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.
Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible
match for their daughter, to whom they could give little
fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly
fair.  Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many
years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William
gave it as his decided opinion that whenever Mr. Collins should
be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly
expedient that both he and his wife should make their
appearance at St. James's.  The whole family, in short, were
properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The younger girls formed
hopes of _coming_ _out_ a year or two sooner than they might
otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their
apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.  Charlotte
herself was tolerably composed.  She had gained her point, and
had time to consider of it.  Her reflections were in general
satisfactory.  Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her
must be imaginary.  But still he would be her husband. --
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage
had always been her object; it was the only honourable
provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and
however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.  This preservative she had
now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having
ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The
least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise
it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she
valued beyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would
wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution
was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.  She resolved to give her the information
herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to
Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before
any of the family.  A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty;
for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in
such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising
great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous
love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see
any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed
when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with
great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be
to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements
might allow him to visit them.

"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive;
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as
soon as possible."

They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means
wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,

"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation
here, my good sir? -- You had better neglect your relations,
than run the risk of offending your patroness."

"My dear sir, " replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged
to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my
not taking so material a step without her ladyship's
concurrence."

"You cannot be too much on your guard.  Risk any thing rather
than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by
your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly
probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall
take no offence."

"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by
such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will
speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well
as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in
Hertfordshire.  As for my fair cousins, though my absence may
not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the
liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cousin Elizabeth."

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them
equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.
Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of
paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary
might have been prevailed on to accept him.  She rated his
abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though
by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if
encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as
her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.  But on the
following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.  Miss
Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference
with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with
her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day
or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost
as far from possibility as that she could encourage him
herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to
overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help
crying out,

"Engaged to Mr. Collins!  my dear Charlotte, -- impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in
telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on
receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than
she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly
replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? -- Do you think it
incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any
woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed
with you?"

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong
effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness
that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to
her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.

"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte, -- "you must
be surprised, very much surprised, -- so lately as Mr. Collins
was wishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think
it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have
done.  I am not romantic you know.  I never was, I ask only a
comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character,
connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can
boast on entering the marriage state."

Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" -- and after an
awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left
to reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before
she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a
match.  The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of
marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his
being now accepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte's
opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she
could not have supposed it possible that, when called into
action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to
worldly advantage.  Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a
most humiliating picture! -- And to the pang of a friend
disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the
distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend
to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.

                              __

<CHAPTER XXIII (23)>

ELIZABETH was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting
on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised
to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by
his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.  With
many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the
prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the
matter, -- to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia,
always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"Good Lord!  Sir William, how can you tell such a story? --
Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have
borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good
breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave
to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened
to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so
unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his
account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte
herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of
her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her
congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined
by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness
that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from
London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great
deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them
than her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she
persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly,
she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly,
she trusted that they would never be happy together; and
fourthly, that the match might be broken off.  Two inferences,
however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the
other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all;
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest
of the day.  Nothing could console and nothing appease her. --
Nor did that day wear out her resentment.  A week elapsed
before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month
passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas
without being rude, and many months were gone before she could
at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,
and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most
agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that
Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably
sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his
daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she
said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for
their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider
it as improbable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss
Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected
them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at
Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to
retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well
married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual
to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and
ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness
away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which
kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth
felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist
between them again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made
her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude
and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken,
and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of
his return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was
counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.
The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on
Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the
solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the
family might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience
on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous
expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that
it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had
been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again
at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday
fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved
his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as
possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument
with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter
of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much
disposed to complain of it as her husband. -- It was very
strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas
Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly
troublesome. -- She hated having visitors in the house while
her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people
the most disagreeable.  Such were the gentle murmurs of
Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of
Mr. Bingley's continued absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings
of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of
his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report
which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed
to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was
indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in
keeping him away.  Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so
destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the
stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently
recurring.  The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and
of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she
feared, for the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course,
more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was
desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,
therefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such
delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which
she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his
arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not
come back, she should think herself very ill used.  It needed
all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight,
but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it
had been on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however,
to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the
business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his
company.  The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas
Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to
make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very
mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an
agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of
hearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to
her.  As her successor in that house, she regarded her with
jealous abhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them she
concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced
that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving
to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as
Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all this to
her husband.

"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that
Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_
should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her
take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us hope
for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be
the survivor."

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore,
instead of making any answer, she went on as before,

"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate,
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it."

"What should not you mind?"

"I should not mind any thing at all."

"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."

"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the
entail.  How any one could have the conscience to entail away
an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all
for the sake of Mr. Collins too! -- Why should _he_ have it
more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.

<VOLUME II>
<CHAPTER I (24)>

MISS Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The
very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all
settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her
brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to
his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the
rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed
affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss
Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions
were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their
increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment
of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some
plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.  Elizabeth,
to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided between
concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss
Darcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she
doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had
always been disposed to like him, she could not think without
anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper,
that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of
his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own
happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.  Had his own
happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been
allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best;
but her sister's was involved in it, as, she thought, he must
be sensible himself.  It was a subject, in short, on which
reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.  She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard
had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends'
interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment,
or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the
case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by
the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her
peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her
feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving
them together, after a longer irritation than usual about
Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,

"Oh!  that my dear mother had more command over herself; she
can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual
reflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last
long.  He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were
before."

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but
said nothing.

"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you
have no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable
man of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either
to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God!
I have not _that_ pain.  A little time therefore. -- I shall
certainly try to get the better."

With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort
immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy
on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but
myself."

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do
not know what to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you
justice, or loved you as you deserve."

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and
threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.

"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.  _You_ wish to think
all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any
body.  _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set
yourself against it.  Do not be afraid of my running into any
excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good
will.  You need not.  There are few people whom I really love,
and still fewer of whom I think well.  The more I see of the
world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day
confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human
characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on
the appearance of either merit or sense.  I have met with two
instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is
Charlotte's marriage.  It is unaccountable!  in every view it
is unaccountable!"

"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.
They will ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance
enough for difference of situation and temper.  Consider
Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady
character.  Remember that she is one of a large family; that as
to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to
believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."

"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no
one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were
I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should
only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her
heart.  My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous,
narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and
you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him,
cannot have a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend
her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake
of one individual, change the meaning of principle and
integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that
selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security
for happiness."

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"
replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by
seeing them happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded
to something else.  You mentioned two instances.  I cannot
misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain
me by thinking _that_ _person_ to blame, and saying your
opinion of him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively
young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.  It is very
often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy
admiration means more than it does."

"And men take care that they should."

"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have
no idea of there being so much design in the world as some
persons imagine."

"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to
design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or
to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be
misery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's
feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business,"

"And do you impute it to either of those?"

"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by
saying what I think of persons you esteem.  Stop me whilst you
can."

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."

"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."

"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me,
no other woman can secure it."

"Your first position is false.  They may wish many things
besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and
consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the
importance of money, great connections, and pride."

"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,"
replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you
are supposing.  They have known her much longer than they have
known me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever
may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have
opposed their brother's.  What sister would think herself at
liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?  If they believed him attached to me, they would
not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting
unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.  Do not distress
me by the idea.  I am not ashamed of having been mistaken --
or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.  Let me
take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be
understood."

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time
Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his
returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which
Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little
chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.  Her
daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not
believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when
he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement
was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat
every day.  Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley
must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  "So, Lizzy,"
said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.
I congratulate her.  Next to being married, a girl likes to
be crossed in love a little now and then.  It is something
to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her
companions.  When is your turn to come?  You will hardly
bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is your time.  Here are
officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies
in the country.  Let Wickham be _your_ man.  He is a pleasant
fellow, and would jilt you creditably."

"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."

"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that,
whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate
mother who will always make the most of it."

Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the
gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many
of the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other
recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.  The
whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on
Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now
openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy
before they had known any thing of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might
be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the
society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always
pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes
-- but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst
of men.

                              __

<CHAPTER II (25)>

AFTER a week spent in professions of love and schemes of
felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by
the arrival of Saturday.  The pain of separation, however,
might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the
reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope that shortly
after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be
fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.  He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before;
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and
promised their father another letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of
receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend
the Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,
gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by
nature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had
difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and
within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred
and agreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent,
elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn
nieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there
subsisted a very particular regard.  They had frequently been
staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was
to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.  It
became her turn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to
relate, and much to complain of.  They had all been very
ill-used since she last saw her sister.  Two of her girls had
been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.

"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got
Mr. Bingley, if she could.  But, Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  it is
very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife
by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.  He
made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.  The
consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter
married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.  The Lucases are very artful people
indeed, sister.  They are all for what they can get.  I am
sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It makes me very
nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to
have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of
comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long
sleeves."

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given
before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence
with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion
to her nieces, turned the conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the
subject.  "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for
Jane," said she.  "I am sorry it went off.  But these things
happen so often!  A young man, such as you describe
Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a
few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."

"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it
will not do for _us_.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does
not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade
a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl,
whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."

"But that expression of ``violently in love'' is so hackneyed,
so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an
half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.
Pray, how _violent_ _was_ Mr. Bingley's love?"

"I never saw a more promising inclination.  He was growing
quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At
his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not
asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself without
receiving an answer.  Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not
general incivility the very essence of love?"

"Oh, yes! -- of that kind of love which I suppose him to have
felt.  Poor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her
disposition, she may not get over it immediately.  It had
better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed
yourself out of it sooner.  But do you think she would be
prevailed on to go back with us?  Change of scene might be of
service -- and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as
useful as anything."

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt
persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.

"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with
regard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so
different a part of town, all our connections are so different,
and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very
improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to
see her."

"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody
of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call
on Jane in such a part of London -- !  My dear aunt, how could
you think of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a
place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a
month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities,
were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never
stirs without him."

"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But
does not Jane correspond with the sister?  _She_ will not be
able to help calling."

"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to
place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of
Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a
solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination,
that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.  It was
possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his
affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his
friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of
Jane's attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and
the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time,
than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same
house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning
with her, without any danger of seeing him.

The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the
Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day
without its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided
for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did
not once sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was
for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which
officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these
occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.  Without
supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in
love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make
her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on
the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her
the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a dozen
years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable
time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged.
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though
Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's
father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her
fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been
in the way of procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy
by character perfectly well.  Here, consequently, was an
inexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her
recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which
Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on
the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself.  On being made acquainted with the present
Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something
of that gentleman's reputed disposition, when quite a lad,
which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she
recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken
of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.

MRS. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly
given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her
alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus
went on:

"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely
because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not
afraid of speaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on
your guard.  Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve
him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so
very imprudent.  I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a
most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought
to have, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is
-- you must not let your fancy run away with you.  You have
sense, and we all expect you to use it.  Your father would
depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You
must not disappoint your father."

"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."

"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care
of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love
with me, if I can prevent it."

"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."

"I beg your pardon.  I will try again.  At present I am not in
love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is,
beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and
if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be
better that he should not.  I see the imprudence of it. -- Oh!
_that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! -- My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honor; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.
My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my
dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any
of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is
affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want
of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how
can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures
if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be
wisdom to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is
not to be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe
myself his first object.  When I am in company with him, I will
not be wishing.  In short, I will do my best."

"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here
so very often.  At least, you should not _remind_ your mother
of inviting him."

"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious
smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from
_that_.  But do not imagine that he is always here so often.
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited
this week.  You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of
constant company for her friends.  But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now,
I hope you are satisfied."

Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked
her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful
instance of advice being given on such a point without being
resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been
quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode
with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to
Mrs. Bennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she
was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and
even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she
"_wished_ they might be happy."  Thursday was to be the wedding
day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and
when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected
herself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went down
stairs together, Charlotte said,

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."

"_That_ you certainly shall."

"And I have another favour to ask.  Will you come and see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."

"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me,
therefore, to come to Hunsford."

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure
in the visit.

"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added
Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party.
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for
Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or
to hear on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from her
friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as
it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was
impossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling
that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though
determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.  Charlotte's first
letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there
could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her
new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she
would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters
were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on
every point exactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote
cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned
nothing which she could not praise.  The house, furniture,
neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady
Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.  It was
Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally
softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her
own visit there, to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce
their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again,
Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of
the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as
impatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town, without
either seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it,
however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from
Longbourn had by some accident been lost.

"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of
the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in
Grosvenor-street."

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss
Bingley.  "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her
words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for
giving her no notice of my coming to London.  I was right,
therefore; my last letter had never reached her.  I enquired
after their brother, of course.  He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.  I
found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.  I wish I could
see her.  My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst
were going out.  I dare say I shall soon see them here."

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her
that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's
being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She
endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but
she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and
inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did
at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive
herself no longer.  The letter which she wrote on this occasion
to her sister, will prove what she felt.

"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing
in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to
have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do
not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what
her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your
suspicion.  I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing
to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline
did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a
line, did I receive in the mean time.  When she did come, it
was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a
slight, formal, apology for not calling before, said not a word
of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered
a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to
continue the acquaintance no longer.  I pity, though I cannot
help blaming her.  She was very wrong in singling me out as she
did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
her side.  But I pity her, because she must feel that she has
been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for
her brother is the cause of it, I need not explain myself
farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless,
yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour
to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever
anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears
now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met
long, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am certain,
from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her
manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he
is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If I
were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted
to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all
this.  But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy: your affection, and
the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear
from you very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never
returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
with any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am
extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our
friends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.

Your's, &c."

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned
as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the
sister at least.  All expectation from the brother was now
absolutely over.  She would not even wish for any renewal of
his attentions.  His character sunk on every review of it; and
as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to
Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry
Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make
him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and
Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to
her aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had
subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some
one else.  Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she
could see it and write of it without material pain.  Her heart
had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had
fortune permitted it.  The sudden acquisition of ten thousand
pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom
he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less
clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not
quarrel with him for his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the
contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that
it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to
allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating
the circumstances, she thus went on: -- "I am now convinced, my
dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I
really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at
present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.
But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are
even impartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I
hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.  There can be no love in all
this.  My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should
certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance,
were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I
regret my comparative insignificance.  Importance may sometimes
be purchased too dearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection
much more to heart than I do.  They are young in the ways of
the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as
the plain."

                              __

<CHAPTER IV (27)>

WITH no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and
otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,
sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February
pass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had
not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but
Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she
gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire
of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.
Collins.  There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a
mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be
faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in
short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry
for any delay.  Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was
finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.  She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.  The
improvement of spending a night in London was added in time,
and the plan became perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly
miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked
her going that he told her to write to him, and almost promised
to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly
friendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not
make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and
to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the
first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu,
wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to
expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion
of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever
attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted
from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must
always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make
her think him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas and his
daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as
himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and
were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of
the chaise.  Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir
William's too long.  He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities
were worn out like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it
so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.  As they drove
to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window
watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was
there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her
face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On
the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose
eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not
seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All
was joy and kindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the
morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the
theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first
subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than
astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that
though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were
periods of dejection.  It was reasonable, however, to hope,
that they would not continue long.  Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street,
and repeated conversations occurring at different times between
Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her
heart, given up the acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion,
and complimented her on bearing it so well.

"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss
King?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."

"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial
affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where
does discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you
were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent;
and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten
thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."

"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is,
I shall know what to think."

"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of
her."

"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her
grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."

"No -- why should he?  If it was not allowable for him to gain
_my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could
there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about,
and who was equally poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards
her, so soon after this event."

"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those
elegant decorums which other people may observe.  If _she_ does
not object to it, why should _we_?"

"_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.  It only shews
her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling."

"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.  _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."

"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.  I should be sorry,
you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in
Derbyshire."

"Oh!  if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men
who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in
Hertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all.
Thank Heaven!  I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man
who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor
sense to recommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth
knowing, after all."

"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of
disappointment."

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she
had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her
uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking
in the summer.

"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said
Mrs. Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.  "My
dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!  what
felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to
disappointment and spleen.  What are men to rocks and
mountains?  Oh!  what hours of transport we shall spend!  And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers,
without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.  We
_will_ know where we have gone -- we _will_ recollect what we
have seen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled
together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe
any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its
relative situation.  Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."

                              __

<CHAPTER V (28)>

EVERY object in the next day's journey was new and interesting
to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment;
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all
fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was
a constant source of delight.

When they left the high-road for the lane to Hunsford, every
eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected
to bring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their
boundary on one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of
all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernable.  The garden sloping to
the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the
laurel hedge, everything declared that they were arriving.
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the
carriage stopped at a small gate, which led by a short gravel
walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.  In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other.  Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend
with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more
satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately
received.  She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not
altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it
had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear
and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.  They were
then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of
the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in
the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his
wife's offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could
not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the
room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself
particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she
had lost in refusing him.  But though every thing seemed neat
and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of
repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that
she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.  When
Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably
be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily
turned her eye on Charlotte.  Once or twice she could discern a
faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture
in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an
account of their journey, and of all that had happened in
London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the
cultivation of which he attended himself.  To work in his
garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth
admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulnes of the excercise, and owned she encouraged
it as much as possible.  Here, leading the way through every
walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to
utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with
a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.  He could
number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many
trees there were in the most distant clump.  But of all the
views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of
Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the
park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two
meadows, but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the
remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William
accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the
house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the
opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.  It was
rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was
fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.  When Mr. Collins
could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort
throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it,
Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.  She had already
learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.  It was
spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins
joining in, observed,

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady
Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need
not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability
and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured
with some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have
scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and
my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us
during your stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming.  We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never
allowed to walk home.  Her ladyship's carriage is regularly
ordered for us.  I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's
carriages, for she has several."

"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"
added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."

"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the
sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire
news, and telling again what had been already written; and when
it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to
meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand
her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her
husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet
tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions
of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings.  A lively imagination soon settled it all.  About the
middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole
house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard
somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling
loudly after her.  She opened the door, and met Maria in the
landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,

"Oh, my dear Eliza!  pray make haste and come into the
dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not
tell you what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment."

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing
more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the
lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a
low phaeton at the garden gate.

"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.  "I expected at least that
the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady
Catherine and her daughter!"

"La!  my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is
not Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives
with them.  The other is Miss De Bourgh.  Only look at her.
She is quite a little creature.  Who would have thought she
could be so thin and small!"

"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all
this wind.  Why does she not come in?"

"Oh!  Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest
of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in."

"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other
ideas.  "She looks sickly and cross. -- Yes, she will do for
him very well.  She will make him a very proper wife."

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's
high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest
contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly
bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove
on, and the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no
sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on
their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them
know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next
day.

                              __

<CHAPTER VI (29)>

MR. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was
complete.  The power of displaying the grandeur of his
patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see
her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he
had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be
given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine's
condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all
surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea
and spend the evening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my
knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.  But who
could have foreseen such an attention as this?  Who could have
imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an
invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately
after your arrival!"

"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir
William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great
really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to
acquire.  About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding
are not uncommon."

Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day, or next
morning, but their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully
instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of
such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might
not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to
Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your
apparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of
dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.  I would
advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is
superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply
dressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their
different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady
Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her
dinner. -- Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her
manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been
little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension, as her
father had done to his presentation at St. James's.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half
a mile across the park. -- Every park has its beauty and its
prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though
she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the
scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his
enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his
relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir
Lewis De Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was
every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look
perfectly calm. -- Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.  She
had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from
any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere
stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness
without trepidation.

From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with
a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments,
they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room
where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were
sitting. -- Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to
receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her
husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies
and thanks which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so
completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had
but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his
seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost
out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing
which way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the
scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. -- Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving
them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she
said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her
self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day
altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he
had represented.

"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and
if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most
strenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be
done in education without steady and regular instruction, and
nobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many
families I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am
always glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my
means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another
young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and
the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I
tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?  She
finds Miss Pope a treasure.  ``Lady Catherine,'' said she,
``you have given me a treasure.''  Are any of your younger
sisters out, Miss Bennet?"

"Yes, Ma'am, all."

"All! -- What, all five out at once?  Very odd! -- And you
only the second. -- The younger ones out before the elder are
married! -- Your younger sisters must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps _she_ is full young
to be much in company.  But really, Ma'am, I think it would be
very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their
share of society and amusement because the elder may not have
the means or inclination to marry early. -- The last born has
as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.  And
to be kept back on such a motive! -- I think it would not be
very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."

"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person. -- Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth
smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a
direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first
creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified
impertinence!

"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, -- therefore you
need not conceal your age."

"I am not one and twenty."

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card
tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and
Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose
to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting
Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was
superlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did
not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed
her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.  A great deal more passed
at the other table, Lady Catherine was generally speaking --
stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some
anecdote of herself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to
every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he
won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir
William did not say much.  He was storing his memory with
anecdotes and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they
chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to
Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine
determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.  From
these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the
coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's
side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.  As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on
by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at
Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable
than it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her
some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was
very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own
hands.


<CHAPTER VIII (31)>

COLONEL Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the
parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add
considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation
thither, for while there were visitors in the house they could
not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week
after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such
an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church
to come there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen
very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel
Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during
the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour
they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing room.  Her
ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their
company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get
nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her
nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than
to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing
was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's
pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now
seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and
Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books
and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well
entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so
much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady
Catherine herself as well as of Mr. Darcy.  _His_ eyes had been
soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of
curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the
feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple
to call out,

"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are
talking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear
what it is."

"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able
to avoid a reply.

"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my
delight.  I must have my share in the conversation, if you are
speaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,
who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better
natural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a
great proficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed
her to apply.  I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's
proficiency.

"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect
to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."

"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such
advice.  She practises very constantly."

"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I
next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any
account.  I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in
music is to be acquired, without constant practice.  I have
told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really
well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no
instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to
come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in
Mrs. Jenkinson's room.  She would be in nobody's way, you know,
in that part of the house."

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding,
and made no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of
having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to
the instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine
listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her
other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving
with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte, stationed
himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.  Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this
state to hear me?  But I will not be alarmed though your sister
_does_ play so well.  There is a stubbornness about me that
never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.  My
courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."

"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because
you could not really believe me to entertain any design of
alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance
long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in
occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your
own."

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said
to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very
pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able
to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had
hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed,
Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you
knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and, give me leave
to say, very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to
retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your
relations to hear."

"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.

"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried
Colonel Fitzwilliam.  "I should like to know how he behaves
among strangers."

"You shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very
dreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in
Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball -- and at this
ball, what do you think he did?  He danced only four dances!
I am sorry to pain you -- but so it was.  He danced only four
dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of
a partner.  Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."

"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the
assembly beyond my own party."

"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers
wait your orders."

"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had
I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend
myself to strangers."

"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth,
still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  "Shall we ask him why a
man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is
ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"

"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without
applying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the
trouble."

"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"
said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen
before.  I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear
interested in their concerns, as I often see done."

"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument
in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.  They
have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the
same expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my
own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of
practising.  It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."

Darcy smiled, and said, "You are perfectly right.  You have
employed your time much better.  No one admitted to the
privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.  We
neither of us perform to strangers."

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to
know what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began
playing again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening
for a few minutes, said to Darcy,

"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised
more, and could have the advantage of a London master.  She has
a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal
to Anne's.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had
her health allowed her to learn."

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to
his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any
other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole
of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for
Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry
_her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's
performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution
and taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of
civility; and at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the
instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them
all home.

                              __

<CHAPTER IX (32)>

ELIZABETH was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing
to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business
into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door,
the certain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage,
she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under
that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter
that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door
opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised
for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood
all the ladies to be within.

They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were
made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was
absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in
this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in
Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on
the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,

"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,
Mr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.
Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect
right, he went but the day before.  He and his sisters were
well, I hope, when you left London."

"Perfectly so -- I thank you."

She found that she was to receive no other answer -- and, after
a short pause, added,

"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea
of ever returning to Netherfield again?"

"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may
spend very little of his time there in future.  He has many
friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and
engagements are continually increasing."

"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be
better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place
entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family
there.  But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much
for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we
must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."

"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it
up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."

Elizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of
his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined
to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very
comfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal
to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."

"I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful object."

"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."

"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met
with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted
him, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an
excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I
consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever
did.  She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential
light, it is certainly a very good match for her."

"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy
a distance of her own family and friends."

"An easy distance do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles."

"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a
day's journey.  Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the
_advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth.  "I should never
have said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family."

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn,
I suppose, would appear far."

As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied
she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane
and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near
her family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend
on many varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make
the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no
evil.  But that is not the case _here_.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins
have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of
frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not
call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the
present distance."

Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,
"_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local
attachment.  _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn."

Elizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some
change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper
from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"Are you pleased with Kent?"

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on
either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the
entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their
walk.  The te^te-a`-te^te surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related
the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet,
and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to
any body, went away.

"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon
as he was gone.  "My dear Eliza he must be in love with you,
or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very
likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after
various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit
to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do,
which was the more probable from the time of year.  All field
sports were over.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine,
books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always
within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in
it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of
walking thither almost every day.  They called at various times
of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and
now and then accompanied by their aunt.  It was plain to them
all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in
their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him
still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction
in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her,
of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in
comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the
best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more
difficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he
frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his
lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity
rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety, not a
pleasure to himself.  He seldom appeared really animated.
Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.  Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved
that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him
could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe
this change the effect of love, and the object of that love,
her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it
out. -- She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and
whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.  He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression
of that look was disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast
gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration
in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of
his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the
idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the
subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might
only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not
of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she
could suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her
marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the
pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in
life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these
advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church,
and his cousin could have none at all.

                              __

<CHAPTER X (33)>

MORE than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. -- She felt all the perverseness
of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was
brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to
inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. --
How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! --
Yet it did, and even a third.  It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it
was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and
then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back
and walk with her.  He never said a great deal, nor did she
give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but
it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he
was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure
in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in
speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the
house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent
again she would be staying _there_ too.  His words seemed to
imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion
to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed her a
little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in
the pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's
last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that
Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again
surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up, that Colonel
Fitzwilliam was meeting her.  Putting away the letter
immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."

"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I
generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at
the Parsonage.  Are you going much farther?"

"No, I should have turned in a moment."

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the
Parsonage together.

"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.

"Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his
disposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases."

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has
at least great pleasure in the power of choice.  I do not know
any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he
likes than Mr. Darcy."

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel
Fitzwilliam.  "But so we all do.  It is only that he has better
means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and
many others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you
know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."

"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little
of either.  Now, seriously, what have you ever known of
self-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by
want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any
thing you had a fancy for?"

"These are home questions -- and perhaps I cannot say that
I have experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in
matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.
Younger sons cannot marry where they like."

"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they
very often do."

"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not
many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some
attention to money."

"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured
at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone,
"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would
not ask above fifty thousand pounds."

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected
with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,

"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for
the sake of having somebody at his disposal.  I wonder he does
not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,
perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is
under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he
must divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship
of Miss Darcy."

"Are you, indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies of her
age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has
the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."

As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and
the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed
Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her
that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She
directly replied,

"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her;
and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in
the world.  She is a very great favourite with some ladies of
my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have
heard you say that you know them."

"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant
gentleman-like man -- he is a great friend of Darcy's."

"Oh!  yes," said Elizabeth drily -- "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly
kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of
him."

"Care of him! -- Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care
of him in those points where he most wants care.  From
something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason
to think Bingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg
his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the
person meant.  It was all conjecture."

"What is it you mean?"

"It is a circumstance which Darcy, of course, would not wish to
be generally known, because if it were to get round to the
lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."

"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to
be Bingley.  What he told me was merely this; that he
congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the
inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without
mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected
it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to
get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have
been together the whole of last summer."

"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"

"I understood that there were some very strong objections
against the lady."

"And what arts did he use to separate them?"

"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam
smiling.  "He only told me what I have now told you."

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling
with indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam
asked her why she was so thoughtful.

"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was
he to be the judge?"

"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"

"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the
propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own
judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner
that friend was to be happy."  "But," she continued,
recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it
is not fair to condemn him.  It is not to be supposed that
there was much affection in the case."

"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it
is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."

This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a
picture of Mr. Darcy that she would not trust herself with an
answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation,
talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.
There, shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left
them, she could think without interruption of all that she had
heard.  It was not to be supposed that any other people could
be meant than those with whom she was connected.  There could
not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the
measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never
doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the
principal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,
however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and
caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and
still continued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every
hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in
the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might
have inflicted.

"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were
Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections
probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney,
and another who was in business in London.

"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no
possibility of objection.  All loveliness and goodness as she
is!  Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her
manners captivating.  Neither could any thing be urged against
my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities
which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability
which he will probably never reach."  When she thought of her
mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with
Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a
deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's
connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite
decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst
kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley
for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on
a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that,
added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her
not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged
to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell,
did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her
husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal
his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by
her staying at home.

                              __

<CHAPTER XI (34)>

WHEN they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate
herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her
employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had
written to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no
actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past
occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.  But in
all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and
which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with
itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been
scarcely ever clouded.  Elizabeth noticed every sentence
conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had
hardly received on the first perusal.  Mr. Darcy's shameful
boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.  It was some
consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on
the day after the next, and a still greater that in less than a
fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to
contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection
could do.

She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering
that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had
made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable
as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound
of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by
the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once
before called late in the evening, and might now come to
enquire particularly after her.  But this idea was soon
banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when,
to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were
better.  She answered him with cold civility.  He sat down for
a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence
of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner,
and thus began,

"In vain have I struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will
not be repressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently
I admire and love you."

Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,
coloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered
sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt
and had long felt for her immediately followed.  He spoke well,
but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be
detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
tenderness than of pride.  His sense of her inferiority -- of
its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which
judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with
a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding,
but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be
insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and
though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at
first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to
resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion
in anger.  She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him
with patience, when he should have done.  He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in
spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to
conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be
rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she
could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance
expressed real security.  Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into
her cheeks, and she said,

"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode
to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,
however unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that
obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude,
I would now thank you.  But I cannot -- I have never desired
your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most
unwillingly.  I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will
be of short duration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have
long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have
little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his
eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less
resentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with
anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every
feature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,
and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have
attained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of
expecting!  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so
little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is
of small importance."

"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why, with so evident a
design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that
you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even
against your character?  Was not this some excuse for
incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?  But I have other provocations.
You know I have.  Had not my own feelings decided against you,
had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do
you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the
man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but
the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to
interrupt her while she continued.

"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No
motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted
_there_.  You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the
principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each
other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice
and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed
hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was
listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any
feeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of
affected incredulity.

"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of
denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my
friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself."

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil
reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely
to conciliate, her.

"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my
dislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place, my opinion
of you was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital
which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this
subject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of
friendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what
misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"

"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said
Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help
feeling an interest in him?"

"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his
misfortunes have been great indeed."

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.  "You
have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative
poverty.  You have withheld the advantages, which you must know
to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the best
years of his life, of that independence which was no less his
due than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can
treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across
the room, "is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in
which you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My
faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But
perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards
her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your
pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that
had long prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter
accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater
policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the
belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed
inclination -- by reason, by reflection, by every thing.  But
disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of
the feelings I related.  They were natural and just.  Could you
expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she
tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of
your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it
spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you,
had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she
continued,

"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any
possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with
an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She
went on.

"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost
say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me
with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and
your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to
form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding
events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known
you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the
world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."

"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend
your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own
have been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your
time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth
heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the
house.

The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.  She knew not
how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and
cried for half an hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on
what had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she
should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  that he
should have been in love with her for so many months!  so much
in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister,
and which must appear at least with equal force in his own
case, was almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have
inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride,
his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done
with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in
acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the
unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had
for a moment excited.

She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of
Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her
room.

                              __

<CHAPTER XII (35)>

ELIZABETH awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and
meditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not
yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was
impossible to think of any thing else, and, totally indisposed
for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge
herself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to
her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the
park, she turned up the lane which led her farther from the
turnpike road.  The park paling was still the boundary on one
side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane,
she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at
the gates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had
now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country,
and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a
glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the
park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being
Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.  But the person who
advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward
with eagerness, pronounced her name.  She had turned away, but
on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to
be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that
time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she
instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting
you.  Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" -- And
then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and
was soon out of sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest
curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still
increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets
of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close
hand. -- The envelope itself was likewise full. -- Pursuing her
way along the lane, she then began it.  It was dated from
Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:
--

"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
apprehension of its containing any repetition of those
sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night
so disgusting to you.  I write without any intention of paining
you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the
happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort
which the formation and the perusal of this letter must
occasion should have been spared, had not my character required
it to be written and read.  You must, therefore, pardon the
freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings,
I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your
justice.

Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of
equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first
mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either,
I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister; -- and the other,
that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of
honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and
blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. -- Wilfully and wantonly
to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up
to expect its exertion, would be a depravity to which the
separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the
growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. -- But
from the severity of that blame which was last night so
liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in future secured, when the following account of my
actions and their motives has been read. -- If, in the
explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the
necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to
your's, I can only say that I am sorry. -- The necessity must
be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd. -- I had not
been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other
young woman in the country. -- But it was not till the evening
of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his
feeling a serious attachment. -- I had often seen him in love
before. -- At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with
you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's
accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your
sister had given rise to a general expectation of their
marriage.  He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time
alone could be undecided.  From that moment I observed my
friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that
his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever
witnessed in him.  Your sister I also watched. -- Her look and
manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without
any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from
the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. -- If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must
have been in an error.  Your superior knowledge of your sister
must make the latter probable. -- If it be so, if I have been
misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment
has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to assert
that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such
as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,
however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. -- That I was desirous of believing her
indifferent is certain, -- but I will venture to say that my
investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my
hopes or fears. -- I did not believe her to be indifferent
because I wished it; -- I believed it on impartial conviction,
as truly as I wished it in reason. -- My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged
to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my
own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil
to my friend as to me. -- But there were other causes of
repugnance; -- causes which, though still existing, and
existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself
endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. -- These causes must be stated, though briefly. -- The
situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was
nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so
frequently, so almost uniformly, betrayed by herself, by your
three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. --
Pardon me. -- It pains me to offend you.  But amidst your
concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as
to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less
generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is
honourable to the sense and disposition of both. -- I will only
say farther that, from what passed that evening, my opinion of
all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened,
which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what
I esteemed a most unhappy connection. -- He left Netherfield
for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain,
remember, with the design of soon returning. --

The part which I acted is now to be explained. -- His
sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own;
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their
brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. -- We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged
in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils
of such a choice. -- I described, and enforced them
earnestly. -- But, however this remonstrance might have
staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that
it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not
been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in
giving, of your sister's indifference.  He had before believed
her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
regard. -- But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a
stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. -- To
convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no
very difficult point.  To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was
scarcely the work of a moment. -- I cannot blame myself for
having done thus much.  There is but one part of my conduct in
the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction;
it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far
as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.  I knew it
myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is
even yet ignorant of it. -- That they might have met without
ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; -- but his regard did
not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without
some danger. -- Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was
beneath me. -- It is done, however, and it was done for the
best. -- On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other
apology to offer.  If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me
may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet
learnt to condemn them. --

With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having
injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you
the whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has
_particularly_ accused me, I am ignorant; but of the truth of
what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of
undoubted veracity.  Mr. Wickham is the son of a very
respectable man, who had for many years the management of all
the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge
of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to
him; and on George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness
was therefore liberally bestowed.  My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge; -- most important
assistance, as his own father, always poor from the
extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a
gentleman's education.  My father was not only fond of this
young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had
also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it.  As for
myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of
him in a very different manner.  The vicious propensities --
the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the
knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation
of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had
opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which
Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again I shall give you pain --
to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever may be the
sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their
nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.
It adds even another motive.  My excellent father died about
five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the
last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
profession might allow, and, if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became
vacant.  There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.  His
own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year
from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having
finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not
think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment by which he
could not be benefited.  He had some intention, he added, of
studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one
thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.
I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any
rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.  I knew
that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.  The business was
therefore soon settled.  He resigned all claim to assistance in
the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a
situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand
pounds.  All connection between us seemed now dissolved.  I
thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
society in town.  In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his
studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from
all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease
of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.  His
circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in
believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found the law a
most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on
being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt,
as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide
for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's
intentions.  You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply
with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse
of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.  After this
period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.  How he
lived I know not.  But last summer he was again most painfully
obtruded on my notice.  I must now mention a circumstance which
I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less
than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.
Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My
sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the
guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and
myself.  About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she
went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and
thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for
there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily
deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended
himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she
was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an
elopement.  She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse;
and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a
day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana,
unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother
whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the
whole to me.  You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public
exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her
charge.  Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a
strong inducement.  His revenge would have been complete
indeed.

This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which
we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of
cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner, under
what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success
is not, perhaps, to be wondered at.  Ignorant as you previously
were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be
in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last
night.  But I was not then master enough of myself to know what
could or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of every thing
here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony
of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and
constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my
father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every
particular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there
may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to
find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in
the course of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you.

FITZWILLIAM DARCY."

                              __

<CHAPTER XIII (36)>

IF Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not
expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no
expectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it
may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and
what a contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as
she read were scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she
first understand that he believed any apology to be in his
power; and stedfastly was she persuaded that he could have no
explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not
conceal.  With a strong prejudice against every thing he might
say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of
comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next
sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense
of the one before her eyes.  His belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his
account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made
her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.  He
expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her;
his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all pride and
insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.
Wickham, when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a
relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every
cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an
affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet
more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,
"This must be false!  This cannot be!  This must be the
grossest falsehood!" -- and when she had gone through the whole
letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or
two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard
it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest
on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a
minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as
well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of
all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to
examine the meaning of every sentence.  The account of his
connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had
related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with
his own words.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but
when she came to the will, the difference was great.  What
Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as
she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that
there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a
few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all
pretensions to the living, of his receiving, in lieu, so
considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she
forced to hesitate.  She put down the letter, weighed every
circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality --
deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with
little success.  On both sides it was only assertion.  Again
she read on.  But every line proved more clearly that the
affair, which she had believed it impossible that any
contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct
in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make
him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not
to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the
more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had
never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire
Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young
man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there
renewed a slight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told
himself.  As to his real character, had information been in her
power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.  His
countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in
the possession of every virtue.  She tried to recollect some
instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or
benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for
those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class
what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many
years continuance.  But no such recollection befriended her.
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air
and address; but she could remember no more substantial good
than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the
regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more
continued to read.  But, alas!  the story which followed, of
his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what
had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the
morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of
every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself -- from whom
she had previously received the information of his near concern
in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.  At one time she had almost resolved on
applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of
the application, and at length wholly banished by the
conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a
proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin's
corroboration.

She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in
conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening
at Mr. Philips's.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in
her memory.  She was now struck with the impropriety of such
communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her
before.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as
he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his
conduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,
but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the
Netherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also, that
till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had
told his story to no one but herself; but that after their
removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no
reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though
he had assured her that respect for the father would always
prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did every thing now appear in which he was
concerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the
consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the
mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of
his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.  His
behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he
had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had
been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which
she believed she had most incautiously shewn.  Every lingering
struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther
justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that
Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his
blamelessness in the affair; that, proud and repulsive as were
his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them
much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways
-- seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or
unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral
habits.  That among his own connections he was esteemed and
valued -- that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,
and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.  That
had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a
violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed
from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of
it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was
incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. -- Of neither Darcy nor
Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been
blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.

"How despicably have I acted!" she cried. -- "I, who have
prided myself on my discernment! -- I, who have valued myself
on my abilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour
of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable
distrust. -- How humiliating is this discovery! -- Yet, how
just a humiliation! -- Had I been in love, I could not have
been more wretchedly blind.  But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. -- Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by
the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our
acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and
driven reason away, where either were concerned.  Till this
moment, I never knew myself."

From herself to Jane -- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts
were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that
Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient;
and she read it again.  Widely different was the effect of a
second perusal. -- How could she deny that credit to his
assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? -- He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; -- and she could not
help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.
-- Neither could she deny the justice of his description of
Jane. -- She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in
her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family
were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying yet merited
reproach, her sense of shame was severe.  The justice of the
charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the
circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having
passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on
his mind than on hers.  The compliment to herself and her
sister was not unfelt.  It soothed, but it could not console
her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the
rest of her family; -- and as she considered that Jane's
disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must
be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed
beyond any thing she had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to
every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining
probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could,
to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a
recollection of her long absence made her at length return
home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings
had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few
minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been
sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and
almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. --
Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she
really rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an
object.  She could think only of her letter.

                              __

<CHAPTER XIV (37)>

THE two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr.
Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them
his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing
intelligence of their appearing in very good health, and in as
tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy
scene so lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his
return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from
her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to
make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting
that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been
presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think,
without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have
been.  "What would she have said? -- how would she have
behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.
-- "I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine;
"I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know
them to be so much attached to me! -- They were excessively
sorry to go!  But so they always are.  The dear colonel rallied
his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to
feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.  His
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,
which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed
out of spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by
supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she
added,

"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg
that you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very
glad of your company, I am sure."

"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"
replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. --
I must be in town next Saturday."

"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.
I expected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so
before you came.  There can be no occasion for your going so
soon.  Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another
fortnight."

"But my father cannot. -- He wrote last week to hurry my
return."

"Oh!  your father of course may spare you, if your mother
can. -- Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my
power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there
early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the
Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you --
and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should
not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
large."

"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by
our original plan."

Lady Catherine seemed resigned.

"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them.  You know I
always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young
women travelling post by themselves.  It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody.  I have the greatest
dislike in the world to that sort of thing. -- Young women
should always be properly guarded and attended, according to
their situation in life.  When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men
servants go with her. -- Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy
of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. -- I am excessively attentive
to all those things.  You must send John with the young ladies,
Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for
it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."

"My uncle is to send a servant for us."

"Oh! -- Your uncle! -- He keeps a man-servant, does he? -- I am
very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.  Where
shall you change horses? -- Oh!  Bromley, of course. -- If you
mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their
journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention
was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her,
or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she
was.  Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever
she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and
not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might
indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.

Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by
heart.  She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards
its writer were at times widely different.  When she remembered
the style of his address, she was still full of indignation;
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and
upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his
disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.  His
attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect;
but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment
repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to
see him again.  In her own past behaviour, there was a constant
source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of
her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were
hopeless of remedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness
of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far
from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to
check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they
were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could
there be of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable,
and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,
would scarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle,
and vain.  While there was an officer in Meryton, they would
flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of
Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.

Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern, and
Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former
good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His
affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct
cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the
implicitness of his confidence in his friend.  How grievous
then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness,
Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!

When to these recollections was added the developement of
Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy
spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so
much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear
tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last
week of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last
evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired
minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them
directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent
on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that
Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,
wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to
Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so
far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.

                              __

<CHAPTER XV (38)>

ON Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast
a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the
opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed
indispensably necessary.

"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins
has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us,
but I am very certain you will not leave the house without
receiving her thanks for it.  The favour of your company has
been much felt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to
tempt any one to our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living,
our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of
the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady
like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the
condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power
to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of
happiness.  She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and
the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions
she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.
Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity
replied,

"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed
your time not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best;
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to
very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings,
the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we
may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been
entirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady
Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary
advantage and blessing which few can boast.  You see on what a
footing we are.  You see how continually we are engaged there.
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of
this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it
an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy
at Rosings."

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings;
and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth
tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.

"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself, at least,
that you will be able to do so.  Lady Catherine's great
attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of;
and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has
drawn an unfortunate --; but on this point it will be as well
to be silent.  Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity
in marriage.  My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one
way of thinking.  There is in every thing a most remarkable
resemblance of character and ideas between us.  We seem to have
been designed for each other."

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where
that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she
firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was
not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by
the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.  Poor
Charlotte! -- it was melancholy to leave her to such society!
-- But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not
seem to ask for compassion.  Her home and her housekeeping, her
parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had
not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the
parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth
was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked
down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best
respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the
kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He then
handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of
being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some
consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any
message for the ladies at Rosings.

"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble
respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their
kindness to you while you have been here."

Elizabeth made no objection; -- the door was then allowed to be
shut, and the carriage drove off.

"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence,
"it seems but a day or two since we first came! -- and yet how
many things have happened!"

"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.

"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea
there twice! -- How much I shall have to tell!"

Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to
conceal."

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any
alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they
reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few
days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of
studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the
kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go
home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough
for observation.

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait
even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's
proposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what
would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time,
so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet
been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as
nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in
which she remained as to the extent of what she should
communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject,
of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which
might only grieve her sister farther.

                              __

<CHAPTER XVI (39)

IT was the second week in May in which the three young
ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street for the town of
---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn
where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly
perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty
and Lydia looking out of a dining room upstairs.  These two
girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in
visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard,
and dressing a sallad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a
table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually
affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice?  is not this an
agreeable surprise?"

"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend
us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out
there."  Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought
this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I
might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon
as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh!  but there were two or three much uglier in the
shop; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to
trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer
after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a
fortnight."

"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest
satisfaction.

"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want
papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such a
delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at
all.  Mamma would like to go too, of all things!  Only think
what a miserable summer else we shall have!"

"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme,
indeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!
Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been
overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the
monthly balls of Meryton."

"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat
down to table.  "What do you think?  It is excellent news,
capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was
told that he need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said, "Aye,
that is just like your formality and discretion.  You thought
the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he often
hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is an
ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long
chin in my life.  Well, but now for my news: it is about dear
Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?  There is no
danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.  There's for you!  She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.  Wickham
is safe."

"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a
connection imprudent as to fortune."

"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."

"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"
said Jane.

"I am sure there is not on _his_.  I will answer for it he
never cared three straws about her.  Who _could_ about such a
nasty little freckled thing?"

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the
_sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly
harboured and fancied liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage
was ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with
all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome
addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.  "I am glad I
bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another
bandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and
talk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let
us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.
Have you seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon,
I declare.  She is almost three and twenty!  Lord, how ashamed
I should be of not being married before three and twenty!  My
aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do
not think there would have been any fun in it.  Lord!  how I
should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls.  Dear me!  we had such a
good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Foster's.  Kitty and
me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to
have a little dance in the evening (by the bye, Mrs. Forster
and me are _such_ friends!); and so she asked the two
Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced
to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?  We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass
for a lady, -- only think what fun!  Not a soul knew of it but
Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we
were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine
how well he looked!  When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and
two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in
the least.  Lord!  how I laughed!  and so did Mrs. Forster.
I thought I should have died.  And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to
amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth
listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the
frequent mention of Wickham's name.

Their reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to
see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during
dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,

"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the
Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were
the subjects which occupied them.  Lady Lucas was enquiring of
Maria, across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her
eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand
collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who
sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to
the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder
than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures
of the morning to any body who would hear her.

"Oh!  Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had
such fun!  as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the
blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I
should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick;
and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very
handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would
have treated you too.  And then when we came away it was such
fun!  I thought we never should have got into the coach.  I was
ready to die of laughter.  And then we were so merry all the
way home!  we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might
have heard us ten miles off!"

To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear
sister, to depreciate such pleasures.  They would doubtless be
congenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess
they would have no charms for me.  I should infinitely prefer a
book."

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened
to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to
Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to
walk to Meryton, and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth
steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said, that the
Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were
in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason too, for
her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was
resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to _her_
of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression.  In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she
hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the
Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the
inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest
intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so
vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

                              __

<CHAPTER XVII (40)>

ELIZABETH'S impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened
could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to
suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned,
and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next
morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong
sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth
appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in
other feelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have
delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to
recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.

"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and
certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it
must increase his disappointment."

"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but
he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his
regard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing
him?"

"Blame you!  Oh, no."

"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."

"No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you
did."

"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the
very next day."

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its
contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a
stroke was this for poor Jane!  who would willingly have gone
through the world without believing that so much wickedness
existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in
one individual.  Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful
to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of
error, and seek to clear one without involving the other.

"This will not do," said Elizabeth.  "You never will be able
to make both of them good for any thing.  Take your choice,
but you must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such
a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one
good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about
pretty much.  For my part, I am inclined to believe it all
Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted
from Jane.

"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.
"Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr.
Darcy!  dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.
Such a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill
opinion too!  and having to relate such a thing of his sister!
It is really too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so."

"Oh!  no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing
you so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample
justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and
indifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament
over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."

"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!  such an openness and gentleness in his manner."

"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education
of those two young men.  One has got all the goodness, and the
other all the appearance of it."

"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of
it as you used to do."

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a
dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one's
genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just;
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then
stumbling on something witty."

"Lizzy when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not
treat the matter as you do now."

"Indeed I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough.  I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.  And with no one to speak to
of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not
been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!
Oh!  how I wanted you!"

"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong
expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they
_do_ appear wholly undeserved."

"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness
is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been
encouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice.
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our
acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."

Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can
be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your
own opinion?"

"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not
authorised me to make his communication public.  On the
contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to
be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to
undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will
believe me?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so
violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not
equal to it.  Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will
not signify to anybody here, what he really is.  Sometime hence
it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their
stupidity in not knowing it before.  At present I will say
nothing about it."

"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might
ruin him for ever.  He is now perhaps sorry for what he has
done, and anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not
make him desperate."

The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this
conversation.  She had got rid of two of the secrets which had
weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing
listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of
either.  But there was still something lurking behind, of which
prudence forbad the disclosure.  She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how
sincerely she had been valued by his friend.  Here was
knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible
that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the
parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance
of mystery.  "And then," said she, "if that very improbable
event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost
all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe
the real state of her sister's spirits.  Jane was not happy.
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard
had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and
disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and
prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all
her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to
check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been
injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.

"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your
opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?  For my part,
I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told
my sister Philips so the other day.  But I cannot find out
that Jane saw any thing of him in London.  Well, he is a very
undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the
least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.  There
is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer;
and I have enquired of every body, too, who is likely to know."


Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,
tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as
her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the
familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet,
whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her
respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely
to make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to
shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever
anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with
whom he might converse without mortification; and though the
uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the
season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope
of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time
when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party
at Pemberley.

                              __

<CHAPTER XIX (61)>

HAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which
Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,
and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,
for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her
earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally
nervous and invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his
affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing
else could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially
when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a
twelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton
relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_
affectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then
gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to
Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other
source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her
time with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to
what she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She
was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from
the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper
attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and
less insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society
she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the
promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent
to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was
necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by
Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was
obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still
moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer
mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her
own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to
the change without much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no
revolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with
philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become
acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood
had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,
was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed
on to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which
Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to
her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a
hope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:

"MY DEAR LlZZY,

I wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my
dear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to
have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope
you will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at
court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money
enough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of
about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak
to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

Your's, &c."

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she
endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty
and expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it
was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be
called economy in her own private expences, she frequently
sent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so
extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must
be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they
changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of
being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging
their bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration
of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest
of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted
a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she
retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had
given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was
gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys
they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's
good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_
of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but
as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at
Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever
of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and
paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the
sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were
able to love each other even as well as they intended.
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;
though at first she often listened with an astonishment
bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking
to her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a
respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the
object of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which
had never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth's
instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take
liberties with her husband which a brother will not always
allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her
nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her
character in her reply to the letter which announced its
arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially
of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on
to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after
a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her
curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she
condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that
pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the
presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and
aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate
terms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and
they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards
the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the
means of uniting them.
